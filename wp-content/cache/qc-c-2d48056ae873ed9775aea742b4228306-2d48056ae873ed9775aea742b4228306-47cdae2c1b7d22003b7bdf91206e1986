				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.&#8221;  - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</em></p>
<p>Hegel was talking about wars, but the insight is relevant to everyday life. What makes dealing well with other people so difficult is that each of our perspectives and motives are &#8220;right&#8221; subjectively, &#8220;right&#8221; at least in some part small or large objectively, and the degree to which they cause trouble is in their coming into conflict with the perspectives and motives of others. I was keenly reminded of this while catching up with an old employee recently.</p>
<p>They (call him Richie) were telling me about how their most recent employment ended. From their perspective, the person responsible for managing the software project they were on the team for (call him Zane) was making poor decisions, and those decisions led to repeated failure in the eyes of the business unit. Richie decided to go over Zane&#8217;s head to his boss and explain the failures were due to Zane&#8217;s poor management. Zane&#8217;s boss, who perhaps had a closer relationship with Zane than Richie realized, told Zane about the complaint and Zane quickly fired Richie. After being fired, Richie went one level higher up in the organization about the issue, which led to a larger internal inquiry that sucked in everyone on the team. Result? Richie, who had already been fired, stayed fired. However, his co-workers validated his complaints and Zane was removed from management and demoted.</p>
<p>I only have one person&#8217;s rendition of this story, so let&#8217;s treat it is a hypothetical. Who is right and who is wrong? Consider:</p>
<p>1. Zane manages the project/team in a particular way</p>
<p>2. The project has a series of misfires and draws negative attention from the rest of the organization</p>
<p>3. Richie perceives Zane as the problem and wants to change the situation</p>
<p>4. Richie goes over Zane&#8217;s head to have the situation addressed</p>
<p>5. Zane feels blindsided to discover that Richie is trying to undermine him</p>
<p>6. Zane sees Richie as insubordinate and fires him</p>
<p>7. Richie accelerates his campaign to have Zane addressed</p>
<p>8. Zane is demoted</p>
<p>This is a typical sort of &#8220;everyday tragedy&#8221; that happens in business. Zane is managing poorly. Richie responds to that badly, neither addressing it with Zane directly or raising incremental issues instead of going nuclear. Each certainly had reasons that seemed correct to them, Zane for his managerial choices and Richie for how he attempted to work up the chain to address them. Both felt correct and justified. And yet, each also presumably felt the other was entirely unreasonable and derelict in their duty. Either or both of them may have been correct. It is a knotted mess, and the very essence of Hegel&#8217;s conception of tragedy.</p>
<p>As with most things, simple communication would likely have mitigated this entire escalation: if Richie or others had tried to address the situation more incrementally, before it become so problematic. If Richie had tried to speak with Zane first, instead of going to his boss to begin with. If Zane had seemed more open to constructive feedback, cultivating an environment of openness and growth. If Zane had used the experience as a moment of growth instead of a club to hit Richie with. Yet, the lack of these things resulted in the project experiencing repeated failures, Richie out of a job, and Zane demoted.</p>
<p>This sort of situation is all too common in business, but ultimately easy to address within the right culture. While conflicts between right and right are inevitable, there is no reason for them to devolve into tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to turn 40 this year. Beyond symbolically being &#8220;in the middle&#8221;, it puts me square in the middle of two very different ways of looking at the work world.</p>

<figcaption>Trying to prevent people from leaving, or punishing them for doing so, is a sign of poor management.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I grew up being taught that you should find a good company, give them your best effort for 40&#8242;ish years, be well rewarded, then retire and live The Good Life of laying around and taking up a hobby. The reality of today&#8217;s workplace is that people search for opportunities that provide the right experience and/or lifestyle, then are quick to seek out and move into positions elsewhere that are better fits for the life they want to live. It took me a couple of jobs to shift from seeing work as &#8220;married forever&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s mostly about me&#8221;. The changes are a good thing, but some of our thinking remains mired in the older, outmoded ways.</p>
<p>Recently one of my employees left Facio. He was an outstanding contributor and very strong cultural fit. However, another company more mature than us recognized his excellence and offered him 50% more salary and going from overseeing a team of two others to overseeing a team of 30 others. It greatly accelerated his career arc, and more rapidly put him in a position that aligned with the breadth of impact he wants to have. While terribly disappointed to lose him, I was thrilled for the chance he was being given.</p>
<p>Often times we do not have that open-minded reaction. More than once, I&#8217;ve seen reactions to an announced departure range from anger to betrayal to disgust. Not only does it not honour the person who is leaving, it is entirely counter-productive. Other employees seeing an adverse reaction to a departure are learning how the employer treats other employees, and take for granted they may be subjected to the same negativity. It lowers morale, decreases loyalty and can have a chilling impact on the environment. Treating people positively and supportively is better for your company, better for them, and ultimately better for you. Positive emotions are proven to increase the quality and length of our lives.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: people leave. Sometimes you want them to; other times you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you are surprised; other times you see it coming. Sometimes they are leaving at a clean and comfortable moment; other times it is exceedingly messy and inconvenient. Regardless of the particular circumstances, expecting that people are (all!) going to leave should be a given, and making their departure as positive it can be given the specific circumstances is the best thing you can do in your role for your employer and for yourself as a citizen.</p>

<figcaption>Being brave and thoughtful when letting people go includes encouraging them to engage you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember the first job I had where I had responsibility for hiring and firing. I was young and inexperienced, promoted beyond the point I was properly trained for. What I quickly found was that letting go younger or more junior people was easy, but letting go older and very senior people was difficult. I distinctly remember one person in particular: letting him go was a decision made by three of us at the executive level, and I chose to not participate in telling him, then more-or-less hiding while he packed up his things and left. It is among the most cowardly things I’ve ever done.</p>
<p>Letting people go is difficult. There is no getting around that. However, particularly as the person who made or contributed to the decision, you owe it to the person to have the courage to engage them and stretch yourself in the process. After all, no matter how much they may have deserved to be let go, no matter how much they may have made your life more difficult, from a power dynamics perspective you are the “winner”. You remain in the soft embrace of your employer, with paychecks continuing to roll in. They are being cast out into an uncertain and likely scary unknown that could have major repercussions on people who rely on them, too. It is thus incumbent upon you to stretch yourself in that termination process.</p>
<p>Now, with more experience and wisdom, I always engage deeply into the process of letting someone go. If it is appropriate, I want to be in the meeting where they are let go. At the very least, I am going to engage them that same day and give them an opportunity to ask me questions, or vent, or just talk about it. They are going to know they have an open door to talk during the “dead man walking” period, or anytime after. And, on their last day, I’m going to shake their hand and thank them for something they did for us that was good. It models how I want other employees to act, how I want our organization to behave, and treats the soon-departing in the best possible way.</p>
<p>They say the final cut is the cruelest. Surely, it does not need to be. By taking responsibility, being brave and treating people with consideration and respect it can be the honorable end to one thing and, hopefully, lead to something better for both sides.</p>
