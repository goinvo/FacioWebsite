<figcaption>When you wake up in the morning, how do you approach your day? How did your favourite grandparent?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to my mother, her father woke up every day and said &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; That is a wonderful ideal to aspire to, especially being someone who wakes up and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have xxx on my calendar today,&#8221; or some other melancholic expression about my own emerging day. On the other hand, while I am up happily working thru my creative endeavors at 2am, in the same situation he would have long since gone to bed. Culturally his approach to and taking on of the day is certainly more attractive than mine, but what I can&#8217;t figure out is whether or not it is ultimately better. Regardless of the qualitative reality of our respective states, my bigger question is: what made me so different, and how can I be more like him?</p>
<p>The problem with this question is twofold: first, the data I have on my grandfather&#8217;s life is meager, at best. I&#8217;ve never gotten to speak with much less interview people he worked with. He was a lawyer, politician, farmer, entrepreneur and oil painter. The only stories I have about him come from his children &#8211; who, like all of us, see the past in uncertain gossamer with unrealized psychic agendas &#8211; and the many stories he told me when we spent time together in my early years. These long periods together and many far-flung stories he told were less about the essential person he was and more about vignettes from his life he thought I might find entertaining, or which he was struggling to preserve in the silicon of my mind.</p>
<p>The second issue is understanding what leads us to be who we are, in the way we are. The potential divinations of the self fall across a vast chasm of a continuum, ranging from an inherently deterministic perspective giving limited weight to &#8220;nurture&#8221; and general life forces, to another extreme where every small moment of our lives smoothed or chipped us in a way to very complexly shaped us into what and who we are. The reality is likely in the middle somewhere, but within the vastness of these extremes are so many possible ways to look at a question that lacks the proper historical data to truly assess in any event.</p>
<p>All of these barriers notwithstanding, I want to figure out if it is realistic for me to transform into someone who gets out of bed announcing &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; Does the strange brew of my nature and nurture allow for it? What enabled him to frame his days in such an optimistic way? I can piece together what little I know like any armchair behavioural psychologist. But ultimately it is a vain thought exercise. Why did my father increasingly frown as he got older, and why do I feel that same frown pulling down the corners of my own mouth? Why did my predecessors live and die happily on a farm in Germany for many hundreds of years, followed by the next four &#8211; including myself &#8211; die in places far-flung from where they were born and raised?</p>
<p>Since the path to understanding these things is a mirage, the fact I aspire to discover them can certainly be dismissed as a bit of folly. But perhaps, just maybe, the data we collect over the next many generations enables my distant progeny to look back and understand their operating dynamics in ways that unlock more range in and control of their own lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that about 90% of people report themselves as being &#8220;above average&#8221; drivers? I suspect you&#8217;re shaking your head, thinking about those poor saps while smugly smiling about being one of the REALLY above average drivers. That little bit of illusory superiority aside, our roadways are one of the most stressful and contentious contexts that we live in. And the reason is because we are all so very different, and being turned loose together in control of fast, heavy machines with a bunch of road rules that some of us follow and some of us don&#8217;t? Well. Thinking about it like that I&#8217;m suddenly surprised there aren&#8217;t more road rage incidents!</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Teams Aren't Easy" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GreatTeams.jpg" alt="Great Teams Aren't Easy" /></p>
<figcaption>The more different we are from each other, the more challenges we face to work well together. And, the more potential we have to be remarkable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Teamwork is even harder and more contentious than sharing the roadways, even though most of us are in fairly homogeneous teams. For any particular profession, many of the practitioners have personalities that share similarities. From auto workers to software engineers, from custom tailors to investment bankers, each of those professions attract very different types of men and women. Yet, despite these similarities between practitioners working together, truly getting the most out of a group of people is difficult.</p>
<p>The problem is the personal nature of working together. Issues related to title, pay, authority and control bring complicated psychological relationships to bear on the work situation. Whereas on the highways we are wrapped in shells of steel and generally function in a correspondingly impersonal way, at work we are up close and personal with each other. And even if we do happen to share a good core of personality traits with sitting next to us, the differences are intensified in highly personal issues related to professional hierarchy and compensation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why great teamwork is difficult. While many of us may share similarities as a starting point, and personality differences can be identified and coached thru, ultimately it is the psychological factors that are most personal, that have to do with our sense of status, providing for our families, and feeling actualized within the group. Just think about how much more complicated it would be to get a team of an auto worker, software engineer, custom tailor and investment banker together as opposed to four investment bankers!</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re frustrated with the people you work with every day, imagine if instead of being a relatively similar group you were thrown in with a bunch of random people from the highway.You might just drive off and never come back.</p>

<figcaption>The Myers-Briggs Type IndicatorÆ is the most used and best-proven tool for psychological preference</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Over the last two years I&#8217;ve finished certification on three different psychological tools, with the fourth to finish up this summer. The one that has the longest history is the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a><span class="small-superscript">Æ</span>. The MBTI measures our †&#8221;preferences&#8221;, which are our inherent comfort levels. What I like about the MBTI are three primary things:</p>
<p>1. It is based directly on the work of Dr. Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychiatry, and has over 90 years of validation between the original concepts, the MBTI method developed between the 1920s and 1940s. It is a honed and proven approach that most people find useful.</p>
<p>2. The MBTI is the most-used personality tool of any kind in corporations. Hundreds of millions of people have taken the MBTI, and its application in the workplace is well understood with proven success models. This name recognition and underlying proven quality will help people appreciate and identify with the openness of Facio as a service.</p>
<p>3. The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation encourages the active and responsible use of their tools. This is in direct contrast to most of the psychological assessment industry, which generally has a very closed and insular perspective on how their tools intersect with the world. Given the openness of Facio, and our belief in the importance of broad availability and dissemination of preference type, the philosophies of the Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation very closely aligns with the spirit we want to put out into the world.</p>
<p>For most people, their exposure to the MBTI or other Myers-Briggs style came in the workplace, or perhaps in a career consulting context. In both cases, there is a dedicated focus on talking about the &#8220;different-but-equal&#8221; nature of preferences and focusing on individual strengths. Those are good and valuable things, and certainly core to what we are offering with Facio. But given all of the data collected over many decades, there are known facts around preference types which can help people better leverage knowledge of their type and others. For example:</p>
<p>- There is significant difference between the amount of people of each gender in each and every type. The types with the most males as compared to females are INTJ (3.3% of all men are INTJ&#8217;s versus 0.9% of all women) and ISTP (8.5% of all men are ISTP versus 2.3% of all women). Meanwhile the types with the most females as compared to males are ISFJ (19.4% of all women are ISFJ versus 8.1% of all men) and ESFJ (16.9% of all women are ESFJ versus 7.5% of all men). More broadly, there are more women of every F &#8211; Feeling type while there are more men of every T &#8211; Thinking type</p>
<p>- EJ&#8217;s &#8211; Extraversion Judging &#8211; are statistically the most satisfied with their work, as well as most satisfied with their company of any of the types</p>
<p>- People who have the same perceiving functions &#8211; either both being S &#8211; Sensing or N &#8211; iNtuition &#8211; have a much higher rate of long-term marriage success than opposite S&#8217;s and N-s that pair up, and are statistically more likely to get a divorce</p>
<p>These are just a few nuggets of data available from Myers-Briggs style type. While Facio is currently focusing on the individual more than the aggregate it gives you an indication of the breadth and potential complex insights that can be divined by tapping the available information.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-419" title="Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/freud-jung.png" alt="Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung" width="300" height="203" /><br />
<figcaption>Relative to their accomplishments, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" target="_blank">Sigmund Freud</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung" target="_blank">Carl Jung</a> are granted surprisingly little respect.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While it seems obvious there should be a service like Facio to make it easy to explore yourself and others better, there is a long history of stigmatization around aspects crucial to self-understanding. The field of psychology has long gotten little respect compared to other so-called &#8220;hard&#8221; sciences. The fathers of the field, people like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and in the former&#8217;s case used as a punchline and in the latter&#8217;s case not recognized far outside of his specific field. More, the whole idea of &#8220;self-exploration&#8221; and particularly mitigated activities like seeing a therapist, were taboo. As recently as 1980 the at the time groundbreaking movie &#8220;Ordinary People&#8221; was seen as risk-taking and courageous for introducing therapy as an acceptable, and not shameful, part of the cultural consciousness. Even more insidiously, generations of men being taught that feelings are weak, embarrassing or effeminate amplified destructive and disconnected behaviours which made exploring much less expressing those things tantamount to failure.</p>
<p>Today things are much better, but vestiges of the old mindsets remain. That is why, as we begin our journey of exploration with Facio, it feels pioneering. While on one hand this is exciting, on the other it is a little unsettling: that we can collectively solve the greatest mysteries of science but still aren&#8217;t accustomed to delving into the wonders of ourselves is counter-intuitive. Hopefully we are able to, more than being of value to the people who enjoy us, help the cultural dialog shift to one of awareness and alignment.</p>
