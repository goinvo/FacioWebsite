<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Just Rewards" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/JustRewards.jpg" alt="Just Rewards" /></p>
<figcaption>Odds are the best employee in this meeting is not making the most.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The short answer is the job market is a highly inefficient system that makes bad guesses. Because companies make so many &#8220;Russian roulette&#8221; hires they can only survive if they pay as little as possible to everyone, regardless of how effective they might be. Not only is this compensation strategy unfair to better employees, it is terrible for the employer who overpays people who contribute less and underpays people who contribute more. Ultimately, this leads to having too many overpaid poor performers. It is one reason why, almost without exception, efficiency within an enterprise steadily drops the larger that enterprise becomes.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a question of &#8220;good&#8221; people and &#8220;bad&#8221; people. The reality is almost everyone can add significant value to their employer if they are in the proper role. This has to do with alignment between:</p>
<p>- Employee and company. Is there an alignment in values, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and role. Is there alignment in skills, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and co-workers. Is there alignment in behaviours, style and energy?</p>
<p>Your &#8220;best&#8221; employees are going to have high degrees of alignment in all nine of those sub-considerations. Your &#8220;worst&#8221; employees will likely fit with three-to-five of these but be incompatible with others.</p>
<p>Next generation businesses will have a higher proportion of well aligned employees and pay them well. They will also be adept at identifying poorly aligned employees and moving them out in an efficient manner. As a result their bottom line will be much better and the people they employ (and don&#8217;t employ!) will have a much higher degree of alignment with their situation, and in general be better paid at the same time. It is the classic win-win that benefits everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The thing I find most remarkable about popular literature and dogma about leadership is how it takes a “one size fits all” approach. While certainly convenient for minting best-sellers, filling headlines and providing pithy catchphrases, the reality is different situations require significantly different types of leaders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Leadership" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GreatLeadership.jpg" alt="Phone" /><br />
<figcaption>Each situation is different, and rarely does a “one-size-fits-all” solution belong.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, the transparency required to run a bleeding edge consumer software firm today directly clashes with the delicate privacy required when leading an old, tradition-laden financial institution. The nature of the organizations require different approaches to information. Or, that the “lead the leaders” skills required to be exceptional running a large organization is ineffective in a start-up, which requires hands-on execution, hustling and leading by example. Or, that the command and control style that can be effective when getting productivity out of unmotivated laborers falls flat when trying to get the most out of curious creatives.</p>
<p>This is not rocket science; it is actually pretty simple logic. Yet the sources offering knowledge continue to favor the “one side fits all” approach. In order to grow, to be great leaders and managers, we need to be aware of our context. The right or best approach or set of skills for succeeding in one situation most certainly won’t prove effective in many others. So the next time you read the latest breathless press about the latest fad leadership method, read about it with a critical eye: what are the right situations to take this approach or exercise these skills? If I try to develop myself, and emulate the strategies being suggested by the gurus, will they prove effective in my unique situation?</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is what works in your specific context: you, your company, and the people requiring leadership. No two situations are quite the same and, while so-called best practices might have some value for you, the best overall solution is one firmly grounded in your particular experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that about 90% of people report themselves as being &#8220;above average&#8221; drivers? I suspect you&#8217;re shaking your head, thinking about those poor saps while smugly smiling about being one of the REALLY above average drivers. That little bit of illusory superiority aside, our roadways are one of the most stressful and contentious contexts that we live in. And the reason is because we are all so very different, and being turned loose together in control of fast, heavy machines with a bunch of road rules that some of us follow and some of us don&#8217;t? Well. Thinking about it like that I&#8217;m suddenly surprised there aren&#8217;t more road rage incidents!</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Teams Aren't Easy" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GreatTeams.jpg" alt="Great Teams Aren't Easy" /></p>
<figcaption>The more different we are from each other, the more challenges we face to work well together. And, the more potential we have to be remarkable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Teamwork is even harder and more contentious than sharing the roadways, even though most of us are in fairly homogeneous teams. For any particular profession, many of the practitioners have personalities that share similarities. From auto workers to software engineers, from custom tailors to investment bankers, each of those professions attract very different types of men and women. Yet, despite these similarities between practitioners working together, truly getting the most out of a group of people is difficult.</p>
<p>The problem is the personal nature of working together. Issues related to title, pay, authority and control bring complicated psychological relationships to bear on the work situation. Whereas on the highways we are wrapped in shells of steel and generally function in a correspondingly impersonal way, at work we are up close and personal with each other. And even if we do happen to share a good core of personality traits with sitting next to us, the differences are intensified in highly personal issues related to professional hierarchy and compensation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why great teamwork is difficult. While many of us may share similarities as a starting point, and personality differences can be identified and coached thru, ultimately it is the psychological factors that are most personal, that have to do with our sense of status, providing for our families, and feeling actualized within the group. Just think about how much more complicated it would be to get a team of an auto worker, software engineer, custom tailor and investment banker together as opposed to four investment bankers!</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re frustrated with the people you work with every day, imagine if instead of being a relatively similar group you were thrown in with a bunch of random people from the highway.You might just drive off and never come back.</p>

<figcaption>Finding alignment leads you to success &#8211; if only Charlie knew!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Are you old enough to remember the old Peanuts cartoons? The main character, Charlie Brown, was the stereotypical lovable loser. The narrative structure was set up so we would root for him even as he failed, struggled and felt sorry for himself. It was a comfortable formula that we could all identify with in ways small and large.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently referred to another of our friends as Charlie Brown, further saying that he always seems to put himself in positions that end up not working out, leading him to struggle and feel sorry for himself. This was an accurate analysis of this fine fellow but, even more, is a great example of how a lack of alignment in our lives can lead to poor outcomes and a general lack of discontent.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my friend Johnny. He is a smart, nice and remarkably resilient person. However he keeps putting himself in &#8220;no-win&#8221; positions that are destined to fail from the beginning. For example, he became an entrepreneur by building a business around his core professional skillset. But he did not add the right complementary people and resources to make the business succeed and it turned into a crushing financial failure. It was not a good fit from the beginning, and either choosing that path could have been avoided or &#8211; perhaps more powerfully &#8211; proper understanding of the dynamic could have led him to make better choices that led to a true success.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the internet it has never been easier to start a business. However, starting a business and cultivating a business are very different things. Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. You need to be competent and at least somewhat comfortable with a wide range of skills, you need to be able to sell your butt off, and you need an unusual degree of comfort with risk and uncertainty. A minority of people can check off all these boxes; I myself barely qualify, and I&#8217;ve had a few successful companies. Yet by necessity or inspiration many people who aren&#8217;t generally well-suited for entrepreneurship choose it. Some succeed; more fail. But by better understanding ourselves as well as what skills and personality traits go into being successful we can make a more informed decision about whether we should go down that path, and how to proceed if we do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge believer in the power of context and information. It&#8217;s not that I want to tell people what to do; to the contrary, I want people to have the tools to make better decisions. If you can see that 23% of people like you were successful entrepreneurs while 91% of people like you were successful working instead inside a large law firm, you can make a more informed decision. Maybe you still hang out your own shingle, but at least you do so mindful of the gaps between who you are and what that context for success looks like. Rather than sort of arbitrarily flopping around based on limited information and understanding you can benefit from moving toward alignment between your essential self and a life that best fits you.</p>
<p>Seeing my friend be perpetually glum and careen into negative outcomes that are fairly predictable even to the naked eye, hurts. We want ourselves and the people in our lives to be successful, well, and happy. Helping them find alignment between their essential self and the choices they make in their life is a powerful gift.</p>
