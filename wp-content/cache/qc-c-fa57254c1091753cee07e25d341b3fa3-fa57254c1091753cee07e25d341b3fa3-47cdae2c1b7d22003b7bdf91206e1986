<figcaption>Not only are each of us very different, so are the various things we can end up doing in our lives.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Did you know that 80% of college students change their majors? And the average college student changes their major three times? While perhaps dismissed as &#8220;just part of the process&#8221;, it speaks to a process that is badly broken. I mean, think about it: when we are in high school we are already being driven to &#8220;choose&#8221;. That&#8217;s because the process of getting into university requires a vision and commitment when you are still just a relative child. It makes no sense, and that fooolishness plays out with people thrashing through their 18-22 years, many unable to get comfortable and making the realization that the path they picked isn&#8217;t the right one for them.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem starts even earlier than that. Our degree of self-understanding as children and young adults is generally woeful. We simply are not in touch with who we are, much less who those around us are, which leads toward us muddling through our lives. A good teacher will inspire us and take us in a direction that we are not necessarily compatible with. An enthusiastic parent will make their interests ours without consideration of what would best fit each of us. An aptitude for a particular subject is translated into something tantamount to one&#8217;s life calling &#8211; when it might not be that at all.</p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks we will look at three different ways that a re-thinking of how we treat children and young adults can lead those future citizens into lives that better resonate with their essential selves. For most of us, nothing in life is quite so wonderful as &#8220;fitting in&#8221;, whether that be with an academic program, a career, our circle of friends, or the person we choose to spend our lives with. Finding fit requires knowing ourselves. We&#8217;re going to talk about how we can help people from a much earlier age get a sense of who they are and how and where they fit.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve never liked friction. &#8220;Never liked&#8221;, in this case, has meant &#8220;avoid at all costs and become agitated if subjected to&#8221;. This has been a boon to me in creative endeavours, as my unwillingness to tolerate things that are broken is near-total and results in rigour and standards that accelerate creative goodness. However I&#8217;ve increasingly observed the positive practical impacts that friction provides in many areas of our lives and find myself, in certain ways, seeking out friction where once I would have avoided it.</p>
<p>One example of good friction is when working through challenges with other people. The healthiest outcome is almost universally achieved when all participants come in with a thick skin, intending to do the most collective good, and encouraging critical feedback from all. On the surface, this is the most friction-filled and potentially combustible way of dealing. But that is because of our personal weaknesses and character flaws. Healthy conflict is perhaps the most valuable tool we have in our interpersonal toolbox. It enables issues to be surfaced, framed and addressed. The classic passive-aggressive fear and avoidance of direct conflict might minimize short-term friction but it will reliably lead to long-term dysfunction and misalignment. Of course, to make an atmosphere of healthy conflict productive, more aggressive or self-centered people who are motivated by ego, control or other selfish motives can poison the &#8220;healthy&#8221; right out of this dynamic. Based on the relative emotional immaturity of most people today, healthy conflict is thus a very difficult thing. But it is one of the real shining examples of where friction in the immediate leads to greater strength for a longer time. It is an excellent thing.</p>
<p>Another example is physical friction. I&#8217;ve never enjoyed physically exerting myself, and from a young age learned ways to avoid doing so. For example, as a little boy, I realized how facile my feet were. Rather than bend over to pick little things up, I picked them up with my feet. Forgetting how silly I certainly looked, and that it probably took me longer than just bending over, I was side-stepping an organic opportunity to physically exercise my body. Sure, we don&#8217;t bend over a lot, so each time was just a little thing. But it is indicative of a general approach to the world that I&#8217;ve employed, really through all of my life. Even when I was an excellent high school athlete, I avoided weight lifting and anything that would provide resistance and friction &#8211; or take extra effort.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve aged, I&#8217;m feeling the consequences of this. Whereas when I was young I was very strong and capable &#8211; thanks largely to the combination of my age and boundless energy, now nearing my 40&#8242;s I&#8217;m feeling real degradation in my muscles, especially my arms and legs. Over my 39&#8242;ish years I&#8217;ve passed up certainly thousands, even tens of thousands of opportunity for resistance and friction that would have made me stronger. Now, I&#8217;m left wanting to get started at a moment when it is harder, and relative to each act will have less impact than it once would have. Lesson learned. I wonder if it would have even been possible for me to learn earlier, without experiencing it?</p>
<p>The friction in our lives often seems annoying, and in many cases completely unnecessary. We go out of our way to avoid it, simply by side-stepping conflict, or picking things up with our toes, or otherwise seeking out the path of least resistance. This is an unsurprising human trait, and one that even seems logical at first. But what we really need to do is make sure our lives are full of the appropriate amount of resistance, in the right ways. As initially counter-intuitive as it might seem, it is actually the path for us to be our best selves and contribute in the most healthy and productive ways to the groups, communities and organizations we choose.</p>

<figcaption>When you wake up in the morning, how do you approach your day? How did your favourite grandparent?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to my mother, her father woke up every day and said &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; That is a wonderful ideal to aspire to, especially being someone who wakes up and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have xxx on my calendar today,&#8221; or some other melancholic expression about my own emerging day. On the other hand, while I am up happily working thru my creative endeavors at 2am, in the same situation he would have long since gone to bed. Culturally his approach to and taking on of the day is certainly more attractive than mine, but what I can&#8217;t figure out is whether or not it is ultimately better. Regardless of the qualitative reality of our respective states, my bigger question is: what made me so different, and how can I be more like him?</p>
<p>The problem with this question is twofold: first, the data I have on my grandfather&#8217;s life is meager, at best. I&#8217;ve never gotten to speak with much less interview people he worked with. He was a lawyer, politician, farmer, entrepreneur and oil painter. The only stories I have about him come from his children &#8211; who, like all of us, see the past in uncertain gossamer with unrealized psychic agendas &#8211; and the many stories he told me when we spent time together in my early years. These long periods together and many far-flung stories he told were less about the essential person he was and more about vignettes from his life he thought I might find entertaining, or which he was struggling to preserve in the silicon of my mind.</p>
<p>The second issue is understanding what leads us to be who we are, in the way we are. The potential divinations of the self fall across a vast chasm of a continuum, ranging from an inherently deterministic perspective giving limited weight to &#8220;nurture&#8221; and general life forces, to another extreme where every small moment of our lives smoothed or chipped us in a way to very complexly shaped us into what and who we are. The reality is likely in the middle somewhere, but within the vastness of these extremes are so many possible ways to look at a question that lacks the proper historical data to truly assess in any event.</p>
<p>All of these barriers notwithstanding, I want to figure out if it is realistic for me to transform into someone who gets out of bed announcing &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; Does the strange brew of my nature and nurture allow for it? What enabled him to frame his days in such an optimistic way? I can piece together what little I know like any armchair behavioural psychologist. But ultimately it is a vain thought exercise. Why did my father increasingly frown as he got older, and why do I feel that same frown pulling down the corners of my own mouth? Why did my predecessors live and die happily on a farm in Germany for many hundreds of years, followed by the next four &#8211; including myself &#8211; die in places far-flung from where they were born and raised?</p>
<p>Since the path to understanding these things is a mirage, the fact I aspire to discover them can certainly be dismissed as a bit of folly. But perhaps, just maybe, the data we collect over the next many generations enables my distant progeny to look back and understand their operating dynamics in ways that unlock more range in and control of their own lives.</p>

			<p>Growing up, arranged marriage was treated as a punchline. It was presented in movies and other popular culture as an outdated, senseless tradition that sought only to control the young and run contrary to American notions of freedom.</p>
<p>To be clear: no, this article will not suggest that we go back to a world of arranged marriages. People exercising their own choice to select a life partner &#8211; or even IF they select a life partner &#8211; is the more humane approach. But it is folly to discount centuries-old traditions as ignorant and senseless; we have tossed out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Indeed, in discarding arranged marriage we did away with the valuable knowledge and experience of elders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Power of Shared Knowledge" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chairs.jpg" alt="Chairs" /><br />
<figcaption>Picking the people who will best complement you is often a matter of common sense.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is a statistical fact that people with particular similarities are more likely to have lasting, successful marriages. Similar cultural backgrounds. Similar socio-economic groups. Similar religious and spiritual grounding. Complementary personality traits. In trying to espouse American values of freedom our popular culture focused on romantic comedies with quirky, unexpected, and decidedly different boy-meets-girl stories. This cheeky brand of entertainment entirely ignored the fact that these relationships are statistically less likely to work. While, certainly, wonderful relationships come out of improbable pairings the reality is a competent old-world matchmaker would probably be more likely to give you a happy pairing. It would just be with a less exotic choice, someone more like you.</p>
<p>A lot of what we do with Facio flirts with seeming to tell people what they should do. It is not our intent. We can present data, insight, statistics, probabilities. But we can&#8217;t tell you one way or another what you should do. Those choices are yours; we just want them to be more informed. We want you to make the choices, but we want to &#8211; with our modern tools and frameworks &#8211; serve the same role the wise and experienced once served when the world was slower and smaller. This brand of shared knowledge, passed from the old to the young, has been devalued on our culture. It shouldn&#8217;t be and, to what degree we are able to contribute wisdom, we surely intend to do so.</p>

			<p>We typically equate personal growth as a positive, proactive thing.†In reality, each of us are growing constantly. Not all of that growth is healthy. It doesn&#8217;t always make our lives better. It is not always good for us. And it is not always fast. But it is growth, of one kind or another.</p>
<p>I grew in very different ways during college years than many of my peers. I was already married, and by my third year had a child. My opportunities to grow socially were certainly limited and, because I was not challenged by school, I didn&#8217;t try and thus was not growing as I could have intellectually. On the other hand, I was growing in less traditional ways for a very young man: I was learning skills of patience, discipline and commitment. In my creative side projects, I was learning how to plan, manage and execute successful initiatives. Of course, while university was supposed to be my context for growth it actually provided very little. Most of my growth happened around my living in a nuclear family at a very young age. It is a path that few of my fellow college-bound peers shared. In retrospect my choices would have been different, but at least I am able to appreciate what I had.</p>
<p>We have been taught to think of growth as something specific and intentional. When you want to learn something, you take the right course or read the right book. When you want to get healthy, you follow a prescribed regiment of diet and/or exercise. When you want to improve emotionally you work with a coach or a therapist. Often these are the quickest or most efficient paths to a particular kind of growth, but they are only activated when we become aware of the choices we are making, identify some explicit context for improvement, and intentionally implement appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of making intentional choices and changes around our physical health. Diet and exercise represent enormous first world industries and are inextricably tied to our sense of self, and even self-worth. At the same time, few people bring a similar awareness to their behavioural and inter-personal selves. Yes, therapy is more mainstream and accepted than it has ever been, but more often it is a reactive effort to deal with trauma than a proactive effort to grow in the best possible way. In a business context executive coaches, and even life coaches, have a place. Many executives and rising managers have enjoyed the benefits of these engagements. But rather than companies seeing these as mission-critical investments they are the sort of thing that usually is indulged when the good times are rolling but among the first cuts when it is time to tighten our belts.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Leadership And Context" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Awareness.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" /></p>
<figcaption>Being intentional about our life and choices creates better outcomes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The choices we make each day define who we are, and who we will become. Awareness of calorie counts, fat and cholesterol have been part of our collective consciousness for over a century. Attention to how many steps we take each day, times we work out each week, and repetitions we can complete on a machine are more recent concerns largely tied to the sedentary work so many of us find ourselves in. However we still do not pay intentional, perpetual attention to our emotional and behavioural selves. We live, we reign in behaviours that are conspicuously aggressive or malignant, but for the most part we simply press forward being the person we appear to be, not striving to grow in different and more beneficial ways.</p>
<p>One of our goals with Facio is to help people live more intentionally. Everything people do is growth of one sort or another. Maybe for the better; maybe for the worse. Maybe fast and effective; maybe slow and suboptimal. The choices we make, the way we live each moment of each day, is growing us in ways we rarely have awareness of.</p>
<p>Awareness. That&#8217;s the first step. Being aware of how we behave and intersect with others surfaces opportunities to grow and mindfully work toward them. The result will be that we realize more of our best selves and almost certainly participate in more positive and productive ways with the people and organizations we care about. No matter what we will be growing in one way or another; we deserve to enjoy the benefits of growing well.</p>
