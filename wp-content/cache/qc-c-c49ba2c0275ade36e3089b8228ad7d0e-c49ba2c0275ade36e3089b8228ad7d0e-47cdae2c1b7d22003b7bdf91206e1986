				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.&#8221;  - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</em></p>
<p>Hegel was talking about wars, but the insight is relevant to everyday life. What makes dealing well with other people so difficult is that each of our perspectives and motives are &#8220;right&#8221; subjectively, &#8220;right&#8221; at least in some part small or large objectively, and the degree to which they cause trouble is in their coming into conflict with the perspectives and motives of others. I was keenly reminded of this while catching up with an old employee recently.</p>
<p>They (call him Richie) were telling me about how their most recent employment ended. From their perspective, the person responsible for managing the software project they were on the team for (call him Zane) was making poor decisions, and those decisions led to repeated failure in the eyes of the business unit. Richie decided to go over Zane&#8217;s head to his boss and explain the failures were due to Zane&#8217;s poor management. Zane&#8217;s boss, who perhaps had a closer relationship with Zane than Richie realized, told Zane about the complaint and Zane quickly fired Richie. After being fired, Richie went one level higher up in the organization about the issue, which led to a larger internal inquiry that sucked in everyone on the team. Result? Richie, who had already been fired, stayed fired. However, his co-workers validated his complaints and Zane was removed from management and demoted.</p>
<p>I only have one person&#8217;s rendition of this story, so let&#8217;s treat it is a hypothetical. Who is right and who is wrong? Consider:</p>
<p>1. Zane manages the project/team in a particular way</p>
<p>2. The project has a series of misfires and draws negative attention from the rest of the organization</p>
<p>3. Richie perceives Zane as the problem and wants to change the situation</p>
<p>4. Richie goes over Zane&#8217;s head to have the situation addressed</p>
<p>5. Zane feels blindsided to discover that Richie is trying to undermine him</p>
<p>6. Zane sees Richie as insubordinate and fires him</p>
<p>7. Richie accelerates his campaign to have Zane addressed</p>
<p>8. Zane is demoted</p>
<p>This is a typical sort of &#8220;everyday tragedy&#8221; that happens in business. Zane is managing poorly. Richie responds to that badly, neither addressing it with Zane directly or raising incremental issues instead of going nuclear. Each certainly had reasons that seemed correct to them, Zane for his managerial choices and Richie for how he attempted to work up the chain to address them. Both felt correct and justified. And yet, each also presumably felt the other was entirely unreasonable and derelict in their duty. Either or both of them may have been correct. It is a knotted mess, and the very essence of Hegel&#8217;s conception of tragedy.</p>
<p>As with most things, simple communication would likely have mitigated this entire escalation: if Richie or others had tried to address the situation more incrementally, before it become so problematic. If Richie had tried to speak with Zane first, instead of going to his boss to begin with. If Zane had seemed more open to constructive feedback, cultivating an environment of openness and growth. If Zane had used the experience as a moment of growth instead of a club to hit Richie with. Yet, the lack of these things resulted in the project experiencing repeated failures, Richie out of a job, and Zane demoted.</p>
<p>This sort of situation is all too common in business, but ultimately easy to address within the right culture. While conflicts between right and right are inevitable, there is no reason for them to devolve into tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies that talk the whole transparency talk almost always draw the line on the historically most sensitive of topics: compensation. There is a notion that compensation is too sensitive, that letting everyone know what each other makes is just going to invite problems that you really don&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>There is some merit to this line of thinking. After all, the way we compensate people is hardly a meritocracy. The nature of business requires us to get most employees at as low a rate of compensation as we possibly can, in order to keep the business healthy. In the process, it is inevitable that some people are overpaid relative to their worth, while others are underpaid. This makes employees having transparency into compensation potentially frightening. More, given the relationship some people have between their relative pay and essential self-worth, the risk can go beyond destabilizing your organization to include impacting the self-esteem of one or more of your employees. It all sounds pretty scary, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a flip side to salary transparency. For one, it promotes accountability. If your organization is generally healthy, employees won&#8217;t let others skate by, and doubly so if they are overpaid relative to their contributions. The openness of information can help you get more out of underperformers in general, but particularly those who are overpaid. Now, it will also encourage top performers who are underpaid to possibly ask for more money. But ultimately, that&#8217;s OK. Paying good people what they are worth should never be a problem; the problem is overpaying people who aren&#8217;t worth it. Another benefit can be that it helps to hasten the departure of poor performers, but if you are managing well you shouldn&#8217;t need salary transparency to accomplish <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>The big picture upside to salary transparency is that it can, indeed, lead to a meritocratic workplace. This may not seem like a great idea to employers, who know that they get great deals on some of their employees, for whom their relative underpayment remains blissful ignorance. But that is the wrong way to look at it. The best companies are populated by motivated high performers. Knowing they are paid fairly is one of the characteristics of high performers. And for those poorly paid poor performers, well, they either need to be performing better or moving along. The net is transformative, as top performers thrive in an open environment and under performers are helped to change themselves or move into a situation where which they better align. It will surely be better for your business, and chances are it will ultimately be better for your people as well.</p>

<figcaption>Context and development</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I read an article talking about how professional basketballer players in the National Basketball League tend to develop relative to the context that they are placed in. Good, young players who are drafted by or traded to top teams that are already successful, having coaching stability, and have clearly established roles and performers in place are more likely to reach their potential. Former coach Jeff Van Gundy credits this sort of development to the player &#8220;know(ing) who he is, and play(ing) to his role.&#8221; This theory goes on to suggest that while talented young players blossom in these conditions, the same players become mediocre when playing for poor teams because, with too much expected of them as &#8220;saviors&#8221; of a bleak situation, they struggle to figure out who they are, and they don&#8217;t have a clear, realistic role.</p>
<p>Thee dynamics are particularly pronounced in professional basketball, where a franchise has just 12 players working for them, making a combined ~$58,000,000 &#8211; or almost $5,000,000 each on average. On the other hand IBM reports having 434,246 employees nationwide, meaning that no matter how stringent and ideal their top-down structures might be the provision of ideal employee environments will often be determined at at the level of a sub-organization or even an individual team. In business we do not enjoy the intense focus on a handful of people that allows the best organizations to consistently develop better performers.</p>
<p>The lesson is that doing things the right way does not just help you perform better in the short-term, it creates an environment of excellence that helps you perform better later. New employees are far more likely to find their place and carve out a specific role suitable to their abilities in a stable and high-functioning organization. Yes, as always, this won&#8217;t prove true for everyone. Superstars often benefit from being &#8220;dropped into the deep end&#8221; and being given more room and freedom to develop as opposed to being constrained by a system. Remember: the Chicago Bulls were abysmal before Michael Jordan came to town, not winning more than 45 games in any season from 1975-1984. He thrived by stepping into the mess. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, while mediocre performers might become better versions of themselves in healthy organizations, they also aren&#8217;t likely to be transformed into high performers just by virtue of the context. The limitations that make them less capable &#8211; lacking in skills, motivation or just generally not embracing and putting themselves into their careers &#8211; are more difficult to change.</p>
<p>Regardless, the bottom line is that the best way to get the most out of the majority of new hires you will make is having already implemented the bedrock of a high-performing culture: stability that crosses all of vision and strategy, management and team composition, with appropriate roles and processes that work well and are adaptable to make the most of the unique gifts and offerings of the specific people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The older I get, the more deeply I value the role of specialist coaches and consultants to get the most out of our people and organization.</p>
<p>At first, investing in a coach or consultant can seem expensive. Comparing their hourly rate to what you could hire someone for, or going down the logic trail of &#8220;I pay Bob big bucks already, if I need to pay these rates to a coach to get Bob on track then why is Bob here in the first place?&#8221; is a self-destructive exercise. Consider:</p>
<p>First, each of us have strengths and weaknesses. So it is likely that many of us are in roles where our strengths are not being optimized and our weaknesses further exposed. Or, if we are, our weaknesses are going to spring up from time-to-time. The expectation that we should just be plug-and-play effective is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Next, none of us are perfect. We have good days and bad; even good and bad weeks or months. While the &#8220;bad&#8221; periods are certainly not good for anyone &#8211; including our employer who presumably keeps paying us regardless &#8211; they should be expected. &#8220;Bob&#8221; in my above example may be struggling, but our simply expecting him to suck it up and improve since we&#8217;re paying him isn&#8217;t consistent with reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, improving and actually contributing more than we are otherwise able takes an investment. This might be an investment of time or money, but either way something different needs to happen to be a catalyst for, well, different things starting to happen! Expecting it to happen through osmosis or because someone is given a pep talk (or development plan) is scattershot and puts the success or failure outside of your hands as a manager or employer.</p>
<p>The great thing about a strong coach is that they bring the total package to the table: it is their time that goes into managing the development; it is their specialized expertise that makes the most of the development; it is their experience doing this with many other people that makes it likely the development is going to succeed.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Coaches: a smart investment" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Coach_300.jpg" alt="Coaches: a smart investment" /><br />
<figcaption>When we hear the word &#8220;coach&#8221; it might conjure up images of someone with a whistle, but professional coaches can transform your employees and business.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember an employee who once worked for me. An extremely hard-working fellow, very nice and generally capable, he just didn&#8217;t seem able to &#8220;make it happen&#8221; in the things we were expecting of him. And, we didn&#8217;t really know how to properly guide or necessarily manage him. Despite the fact he was jut the kind of person we wanted in our organization, we were frustrated with him. We talked about letting him go. We couldn&#8217;t understand why he didn&#8217;t just &#8220;make it happen.&#8221; Instead of letting our frustration take us to the point of letting him go, we doubled down and provided him with a coach. He immediately began to excel. The coach&#8217;s combination of management attention and domain-specific guidance and expertise was transformative. Not only did his performance significantly improve, the coach told us he&#8217;s one of the strongest employees he&#8217;s ever worked with, an absolute model.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#8217;t made the investment in the coach, it would have ended very differently. And, we paid less for the coach than paying a recruiter to replace our employee &#8211; with someone who likely would not have been the same kind of star &#8211; would have cost. Literally everyone won as the company&#8217;s bottom line benefitted, our culture was burgeoned from re-investing in someone everyone liked, and the employee&#8217;s potential was fully unlocked in way that were not just beneficial to success in his role but also to him personally.</p>
<p>This is just one example, but it really illustrates the power a good coach can have. Yes, the hourly rate might seem high. Yes, our intuition might be that the employee should just &#8220;suck it up&#8221; and &#8220;get the job done&#8221;. These are just bad excuses. The investment in a good coach or consultant is an investment of vision. It is one of those uncommon things that is likely to have a positive impact on both your short-term bottom line and your long-term culture and employee wellness. If you have an employee who is generally a good fit, double-down on unlocking their potential.</p>

<figcaption>Being brave and thoughtful when letting people go includes encouraging them to engage you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember the first job I had where I had responsibility for hiring and firing. I was young and inexperienced, promoted beyond the point I was properly trained for. What I quickly found was that letting go younger or more junior people was easy, but letting go older and very senior people was difficult. I distinctly remember one person in particular: letting him go was a decision made by three of us at the executive level, and I chose to not participate in telling him, then more-or-less hiding while he packed up his things and left. It is among the most cowardly things I’ve ever done.</p>
<p>Letting people go is difficult. There is no getting around that. However, particularly as the person who made or contributed to the decision, you owe it to the person to have the courage to engage them and stretch yourself in the process. After all, no matter how much they may have deserved to be let go, no matter how much they may have made your life more difficult, from a power dynamics perspective you are the “winner”. You remain in the soft embrace of your employer, with paychecks continuing to roll in. They are being cast out into an uncertain and likely scary unknown that could have major repercussions on people who rely on them, too. It is thus incumbent upon you to stretch yourself in that termination process.</p>
<p>Now, with more experience and wisdom, I always engage deeply into the process of letting someone go. If it is appropriate, I want to be in the meeting where they are let go. At the very least, I am going to engage them that same day and give them an opportunity to ask me questions, or vent, or just talk about it. They are going to know they have an open door to talk during the “dead man walking” period, or anytime after. And, on their last day, I’m going to shake their hand and thank them for something they did for us that was good. It models how I want other employees to act, how I want our organization to behave, and treats the soon-departing in the best possible way.</p>
<p>They say the final cut is the cruelest. Surely, it does not need to be. By taking responsibility, being brave and treating people with consideration and respect it can be the honorable end to one thing and, hopefully, lead to something better for both sides.</p>
