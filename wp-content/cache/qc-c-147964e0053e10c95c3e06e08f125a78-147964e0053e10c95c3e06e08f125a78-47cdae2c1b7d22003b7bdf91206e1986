				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve now been certified in four of the leading personality methodologies and have studied dozens more. One of the best are the Hogan Assessments, which use three different reports to cover your strengths, &#8220;derailers,&#8221; which are the areas you will likely manifest negative characteristics, and values. In its breadth covering a variety of important areas, the Hogan is one of the most useful tools on the market.</p>
<p>Of course, like seemingly every provider in the human understanding industry, their visualizations often muddy the waters they are attempting to navigate. A good example of that is with the &#8220;derailers&#8221; report, and what they call the &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;.</p>
<p>The formal name of the &#8220;derailers&#8221; is the HDS, or <a href="http://www.hoganassessments.com/assessments-hogan-development-survey" target="_blank">Hogan Development Survey</a>. It endeavours to identify &#8220;personality-based performance risks and derailers of interpersonal behaviour.&#8221; And indeed, the report itself is typically seen as forbidding by the people receiving it. The red bars have a decidedly negative connotation, and when you are getting your report and seeing a lot of red, like an exam at school when we were younger, it is most certainly not a good thing. Indeed, there is nothing in the report to refute this, with the larger red lines explicitly communicating higher risk. It seems very black-and-white (and red!): either you have a lot of red and are &#8220;good&#8221;, or not much red and are &#8220;bad&#8221;. If you are somewhere in the middle, you glance over the smaller red bars and focus on the larger red bars.</p>
<figure style="width: 400px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" title="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg" alt="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" width="400" /></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The shame of it is, this very specific report design does not reinforce the actual story the tool is telling. You see, red bars in the third level &#8211; the one next-to-highest and called moderate risk &#8211; are actually seen as a positive when evaluating candidates. Hogan calls them &#8220;the jewels of personality&#8221;. As my certification instructor taught, you want to see some of these in one&#8217;s report. They represent their personality, the parts of them that will be unique, interesting and have the potential to provide real value. Considering my own report, my excitability does contribute to the charisma I am able to turn on when the situation calls for it, and certainly my high imaginative is woven into many of the best skills that I have. It is accurate. And yes, even though my excitability in particular can be more of a derailer for me, it is as much or more of a strength than a weakness.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in this report reinforcing that. Yes, sure, your interpreter may explain this to you during the process. However I&#8217;ve witnessed how it can be &#8220;in one ear, and out the other&#8221;. For many people, all they are seeing are the red bars. And it is very black-and-white. Big red = bad, little red = good. The report is built that way. It is not just obtuse; it is unfortunate. The jewels of personality are left waiting to be found.</p>
<p>How better to design this tool? From a risk perspective, there are only three things that matter: no/low risk (green light), moderate risk (yellow light) and high risk (red light). For no/low risk, they really don&#8217;t even need to be mentioned. They are only marginally relevant to the person being assessed &#8211; if they are curious about the methodology there are other ways to learn it than valuable space on the core report &#8211; and their relevance to an organization is only in a specific context, such as a situation where a position could tolerate some types of risks but not others. It is the moderate and high risks that matter, the former something to keep in mind and the latter something to vet. But then there are the positives from this report, the jewels. Notably these don&#8217;t come out in any of the other Hogan reports, they just hide here. They should be brought out, focused on, perhaps even the first and primary part of this report. So, the primary focus are the moderate risks &#8211; called something more akin to their very clever and cute &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221; label &#8211; then the high risk should be the second focus and the no/low risk virtually no focus at all. Instead, this report deafens you with indeterminate bars of red.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t decided if this is an article about poor report construction in the psychological assessment industry or the fact many of our &#8220;riskiest&#8221; traits can also be those that make us most interesting and valuable. Both of those points are true and on clear display with the Hogan HDS and its conspicuously absent jewels of personality.</p>
