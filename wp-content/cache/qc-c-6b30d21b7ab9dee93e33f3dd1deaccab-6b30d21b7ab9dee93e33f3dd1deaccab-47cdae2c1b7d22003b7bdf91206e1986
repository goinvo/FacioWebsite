<figcaption>Successful leadership depends greatly on the context and the needs of the people being led.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I vividly remember a happy meeting with a departing intern. I authentically celebrated her good contributions, she earnestly complimented me in ways I would not have imagined, and it was the very best of what a boss-employee parting should look like. It reminded me how much I genuinely enjoy the people I am able to work with in the right way.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the right way.&#8221; That is a complicated little turn-of-phrase. You see, I am extremely introverted in ways that create interpersonal challenges. I dislike large group settings: although I am able to perform admirably on demand, in the context of an everyday work environment, I don&#8217;t and can seem cold and distant. I also dislike inauthentic interactions: when I am able to &#8220;dive deep&#8221; with someone and pay attention to them while they pay attention to me, my relationships are very powerful. However, when the time involved or nature of the interaction is more superficial, I become impatient. Which, again, can make me seem cold and distant.</p>
<p>This particular employee called me a &#8220;great leader&#8221; and that she could not imagine a boss would eschew a hierarchical relationship and be so warm, engaging and directly involved in her well-being and development. This, of course, is the most humbling and appreciated feedback I could possibly get. But so many past people I&#8217;ve worked with would guffaw at the words &#8220;great leader&#8221;, because they knew me in a different context that was less in my wheelhouse for success, or even when I was younger and less developed as a person. While it was joyous to hear those words and know they were authentic and even reasonable for that particular person, I am under no illusion that I am a great leader. I can be, and sometimes am. More often I am, like most people, performing in ways that range from adequate to very good. Rarely great and rarely terrible, I&#8217;m doing my best in contexts that are uncomfortable and with people that I may or may not fit well with.</p>
<p>One of the secrets to being the most of who we can be &#8211; with &#8220;most&#8221; being more of a qualitative than quantitative descriptor &#8211; is understand how and why you thrive and putting yourself into those positions. My particular weaknesses do not translate well to effective leadership in a traditional sense, but each day I am trying to tune myself as well as my contexts in order to more reliably and repeatably be participating in situations that could result in people seeing me as a great leader. Of course I want to be; I just also want to remain resonant with my essential self.</p>
<p>For others, your limitations and strengths and comfort levels are unique and, in most cases, vastly different from mine. The secret for each of us is to get in touch with these things and design our lives to resonate with the best and strongest parts as much as we can. From there we will not just become potentially great leaders, but people living better lives.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve now been certified in four of the leading personality methodologies and have studied dozens more. One of the best are the Hogan Assessments, which use three different reports to cover your strengths, &#8220;derailers,&#8221; which are the areas you will likely manifest negative characteristics, and values. In its breadth covering a variety of important areas, the Hogan is one of the most useful tools on the market.</p>
<p>Of course, like seemingly every provider in the human understanding industry, their visualizations often muddy the waters they are attempting to navigate. A good example of that is with the &#8220;derailers&#8221; report, and what they call the &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;.</p>
<p>The formal name of the &#8220;derailers&#8221; is the HDS, or <a href="http://www.hoganassessments.com/assessments-hogan-development-survey" target="_blank">Hogan Development Survey</a>. It endeavours to identify &#8220;personality-based performance risks and derailers of interpersonal behaviour.&#8221; And indeed, the report itself is typically seen as forbidding by the people receiving it. The red bars have a decidedly negative connotation, and when you are getting your report and seeing a lot of red, like an exam at school when we were younger, it is most certainly not a good thing. Indeed, there is nothing in the report to refute this, with the larger red lines explicitly communicating higher risk. It seems very black-and-white (and red!): either you have a lot of red and are &#8220;good&#8221;, or not much red and are &#8220;bad&#8221;. If you are somewhere in the middle, you glance over the smaller red bars and focus on the larger red bars.</p>
<figure style="width: 400px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" title="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg" alt="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" width="400" /></a></p>
<figcaption>Can you guess where to find my &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shame of it is, this very specific report design does not reinforce the actual story the tool is telling. You see, red bars in the third level &#8211; the one next-to-highest and called moderate risk &#8211; are actually seen as a positive when evaluating candidates. Hogan calls them &#8220;the jewels of personality&#8221;. As my certification instructor taught, you want to see some of these in one&#8217;s report. They represent their personality, the parts of them that will be unique, interesting and have the potential to provide real value. Considering my own report, my excitability does contribute to the charisma I am able to turn on when the situation calls for it, and certainly my high imaginative is woven into many of the best skills that I have. It is accurate. And yes, even though my excitability in particular can be more of a derailer for me, it is as much or more of a strength than a weakness.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in this report reinforcing that. Yes, sure, your interpreter may explain this to you during the process. However I&#8217;ve witnessed how it can be &#8220;in one ear, and out the other&#8221;. For many people, all they are seeing are the red bars. And it is very black-and-white. Big red = bad, little red = good. The report is built that way. It is not just obtuse; it is unfortunate. The jewels of personality are left waiting to be found.</p>
<p>How better to design this tool? From a risk perspective, there are only three things that matter: no/low risk (green light), moderate risk (yellow light) and high risk (red light). For no/low risk, they really don&#8217;t even need to be mentioned. They are only marginally relevant to the person being assessed &#8211; if they are curious about the methodology there are other ways to learn it than valuable space on the core report &#8211; and their relevance to an organization is only in a specific context, such as a situation where a position could tolerate some types of risks but not others. It is the moderate and high risks that matter, the former something to keep in mind and the latter something to vet. But then there are the positives from this report, the jewels. Notably these don&#8217;t come out in any of the other Hogan reports, they just hide here. They should be brought out, focused on, perhaps even the first and primary part of this report. So, the primary focus are the moderate risks &#8211; called something more akin to their very clever and cute &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221; label &#8211; then the high risk should be the second focus and the no/low risk virtually no focus at all. Instead, this report deafens you with indeterminate bars of red.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t decided if this is an article about poor report construction in the psychological assessment industry or the fact many of our &#8220;riskiest&#8221; traits can also be those that make us most interesting and valuable. Both of those points are true and on clear display with the Hogan HDS and its conspicuously absent jewels of personality.</p>

<p>Your best and most valuable employees are also the hardest to ultimately keep. That&#8217;s because the same things that make them so effective for you make them most desirable to the market and less tolerant to survive in a situation not commensurate with the high esteem they likely have for themselves. Since these are the people who create the most value for your organization this is not only frustrating but deserving of the highest strategic importance.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some tips to consider when thinking about how to best attract and retain top talent:</p>
<p>1. Make sure they are fairly compensated. The reality is that the best people know what they are capable of making, and what they are willing to take in the right situation. Trying to employ efficiency methods to constrain their compensation &#8211; a tactic which can work for younger employees and lesser performers &#8211; will surely lead top people to leave sooner or later.</p>
<p>2. Care about their development. While some of their development can and should be focused on how they benefit your company, you also need to help them grow in ways that will not clearly plug into your organization. They want to feel empowered and encouraged, not controlled and directed. Be proactive in helping them figure out where they want to go with their lives and contributing to their process of getting there.</p>
<p>3. Provide transparency. Top performers want to feel like they know what is going on, and have the ability to evaluate for themselves whether authority figures are making good decisions. You do not need to publicly share every shred of company information; what you must do is let them know that most information is available to be shared, then be prepared to share it if they ask to do so. While this seems like the potential to be a distraction, in reality an employee who is incessantly asking to see information likely isn&#8217;t the sort of high performer you want to keep anyway.</p>
<p>4. Allow them to be involved in decision making. Even if they don&#8217;t have the last word, they expect to be genuinely listened to and have their input factored into the final decision. Make sure they are in an environment and under a manager that is inviting of their input.</p>
<p>5. Trust them. These are different times, with flex hours, working from home and a remote workforce now the standard in more progressive companies and industries. The best people will often have expectations that would have seemed ridiculous even a decade ago, and very well might make you uncomfortable. Well, tough. This is the new normal. If you want to keep them and get the best out of them, you need to take a deep breath and trust them. Most high performers, and all truly exceptional employees, are deserving of your trust.</p>
<p>One easy way to think about your key employees is how you would a romantic partner. If you truly want to be with them long-term you need to invest with the relationship and &#8211; crucially &#8211; give them space, control and consideration. You must see them as their own people who will be less likely to leave if you reinforce, and even encourage, their freedom to do exactly that.</p>

<figcaption>We&#8217;ve been taught that rejection is humiliating and embarrassing. It shouldn&#8217;t be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We&#8217;ve been taught that rejection is among the most painful things we will feel in our lives. Rejection sucks. Rejection hurts. It represents failure, lack, falling short, something being wrong with you. On a list of the things we most fear or dislike, for many of us, rejection would be on that list.</p>
<p>How unfortunate.</p>
<p>Rejection is re-alignment. Rejection is validation that something didn&#8217;t fit: a partner, a job, a career path, a university. Whether you are the leaver or the leave-ee, ultimately to reject or be rejected is not a referendum on what was rejected. It is simply a process of moving both sides closer to alignment. Rather than being a bad thing, it is among the very best of things. It represents progress, better outcomes, better realities.</p>
<p>Yes, I know: some of you who have felt particular pain at one rejection or another are skeptically folding your arms and furrowing your brow. I don&#8217;t blame you. I remember my most painful rejections so very well, permanently burnt into my brain. And the pain they caused was immense. The question is: was that pain necessary, or was it a product of my unrealistic framing of the context I was in?</p>
<p>While my feelings were very valid, honestly deconstructing those moments, the framing that caused that pain was not. When I&#8217;ve had difficult break-ups, the pain I felt ultimately had little to do with me so adoring the relationships and everything to do with my ego being bruised, my expectations being shattered, my private self feeling embarrassed, and other internally constructed factors that had little bearing on whatever it was that was ending. I may have rationalized it in other ways at the time, but stripping back the constructed layers to the truth, the self-imposed nature of the pain was clear. I can&#8217;t deny that.</p>
<p>These days, when I look in the mirror I see sprouts of grey in my beard and wisps of grey in my hair. With those signs of physical age have come perspective and understanding of deeper realities. Every relationship I had that gutted me when it ended, I now look back and acknowledge that end was for the best. In most cases, I think it should have ended sooner. The two academic programs I applied to and was rejected from in my career, which made me feel foolish at the time, in retrospect I am so appreciative for. They weren&#8217;t good fits. The gatekeepers recognized that, and they kept me out. Good. What would have been lost by my spending that time in that situation?</p>
<p>Today I embrace rejection. And I am far faster to &#8211; kindly, thoughtfully, empathetically &#8211; do the rejecting. It is a good thing. It is a critical part of the process for achieving better alignment. Each of us, as individuals or organizations, have wonderful outcomes waiting for us. We also have many, many more suboptimal outcomes, ranging from still pretty good to absolutely shambolic. Lord knows we don&#8217;t need &#8220;optimal&#8221; outcomes in our lives, but we also shouldn&#8217;t blindly accept something less just because it is there. We most seek out alignment and resonance with the places, people and ways we spend our time. We should feel empowered to reject others to help them and ourselves find our right level. When we are rejected, rather than wallow in self-pity or lash out in retaliation, we should honour and respect that which rejected us &#8211; if we didn&#8217;t respect and honour them we certainly shouldn&#8217;t feel hurt by their rejection &#8211; and reflect on why there was not a fit. Thereby, we will grow and learn. Thereby, we will find our best place and selves.</p>
<p>Thereby, we will find alignment, success and satisfaction. There is nothing sad about that.</p>
