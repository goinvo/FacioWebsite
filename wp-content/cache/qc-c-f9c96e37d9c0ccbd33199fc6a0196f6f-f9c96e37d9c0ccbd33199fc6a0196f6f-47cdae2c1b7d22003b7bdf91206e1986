				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The thing I find most remarkable about popular literature and dogma about leadership is how it takes a “one size fits all” approach. While certainly convenient for minting best-sellers, filling headlines and providing pithy catchphrases, the reality is different situations require significantly different types of leaders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Leadership" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GreatLeadership.jpg" alt="Phone" /><br />
<figcaption>Each situation is different, and rarely does a “one-size-fits-all” solution belong.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, the transparency required to run a bleeding edge consumer software firm today directly clashes with the delicate privacy required when leading an old, tradition-laden financial institution. The nature of the organizations require different approaches to information. Or, that the “lead the leaders” skills required to be exceptional running a large organization is ineffective in a start-up, which requires hands-on execution, hustling and leading by example. Or, that the command and control style that can be effective when getting productivity out of unmotivated laborers falls flat when trying to get the most out of curious creatives.</p>
<p>This is not rocket science; it is actually pretty simple logic. Yet the sources offering knowledge continue to favor the “one side fits all” approach. In order to grow, to be great leaders and managers, we need to be aware of our context. The right or best approach or set of skills for succeeding in one situation most certainly won’t prove effective in many others. So the next time you read the latest breathless press about the latest fad leadership method, read about it with a critical eye: what are the right situations to take this approach or exercise these skills? If I try to develop myself, and emulate the strategies being suggested by the gurus, will they prove effective in my unique situation?</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is what works in your specific context: you, your company, and the people requiring leadership. No two situations are quite the same and, while so-called best practices might have some value for you, the best overall solution is one firmly grounded in your particular experience.</p>

			<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Going in with eyes wide open" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Courage.jpg" alt="Phone" /><br />
<figcaption>Most of time I spend checking out my iPhone is entirely unnecessary, and often even detrimental.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Last night I had dinner with a woman who told the story about a hiring decision she was involved with. She felt strongly that the person being considered would not work out but the CEO decided to hire them anyway. 9 months later, at great cost to the organization in time, cost and opportunity, the candidate washed out. recounting the story, She shook her head and rolled her eyes. While I don’t know the gritty details of this particular situation, it reminded me of similar rueing in my own career.</p>
<p>The first person I was part of the hiring team for bringing on washed out mere months after being hired. This individual was hired for an “account manager” position. The organization doing the hiring – to which I was new – had an imbalanced sales culture. This person was to be the first account manager in the organization. There were three of us who were making the decision together: myself, who was hired to, among other things bring an account services structure to the organization, and two other, long-time executives. They were both parts of that old, established sales culture.</p>
<p>The candidate we were considering had a long and seemingly strong background in cold sales while carrying an “account manager” title. He was perfect for what our organization used to be. The problem was, I could tell he would not be a good account manager. Now, I was young, this was the first hire that I was a part of making, and I was trying to be respectful of my colleagues. When I raised my concerns about his poor fit for account management, their response was “Yeah, but he can really sell!” I caved, we hired him, and his tenure with the company was ugly. As it turns out he couldn’t even sell. And he certainly couldn’t manage an account.</p>
<p>If I had more courage, or conviction, maybe I could have steered things in a different way. I was in the organization to facilitate change, so maybe a stronger hand would have saved the organization a loss in time, money and opportunity. But I didn’t, and we didn’t, and the results were ugly.</p>
<p>Another example was when my first entrepreneurial company, what became Involution Studios Silicon Valley, crashed and died. In late 2008, I saw the problems coming. And I knew how to avoid them: cut quick and cut deep. My business partner didn’t have the stomach for that. Now, he suggested another path that would have been much better than what ended up happening – just shutting down completely and taking our large war chest in the company to secure a soft landing for ourselves and go onto something else. But I didn’t want to kill the company, he didn’t want to cut 60% of the staff after a huge 2008, and instead we made the cardinal sin of cutting slowly and gradually over time, not making anyone happy and eventually destroying the company entirely. And, in that scenario, we not only didn’t have a soft landing but I was almost ruined financially.</p>
<p>I knew the right thing to do was cut quick and cut deep. I had even counseled clients to do exactly that when I was a consultant. But when it came down to two people – myself and my partner – both with strong opinions, I wasn’t able to get us on the right path. What if I had really dug in my heels? What if we had some big, screaming arguments? Could we have gotten there? Could that company still be a power today? Could the experience have been much better for us and protected and honored our very best employees who would have been cultivated in that scenario?</p>
<p>There is no way to know. But, in each of our careers, there will be various times when we think we know better. When we have an insight, or just an opinion, that we strongly think is the better path to take. It is our responsibility to ourselves, our employers and our colleagues to advocate our position as thoroughly and vigorously as we possibly can. If you keep quiet, or don’t go to the mattresses, and things go the other way, don’t you dare say “I told you so”. Don’t console yourself with “If only people listened to me…” If people don’t listen to us, if we can’t convince them of our position, if we can’t help move things toward the better decision, that is our fault. Either because we lacked the courage to really assert our position, or because we have allowed our influence to be minimized in the organization to the point where we couldn’t steer the decision, or because we didn’t take the time to craft the proper argument and move the necessary people.</p>
<p>So stop being one of the majority of people who shake their head and pile up their “I told you so’s”. Roll up your sleeves and do your utmost to move things the way you think they should be. I for one truly regret the handful of times when I did not honor myself and do my utmost to steer decisions toward better outcomes. Now, if I think something is important, I’m going to be out there fighting for it. It might not go my way, but I surely won’t need to harbor any “I told you so’s”: it is going to be crystal clear to everyone where I came down on the issue. Without question my companies and the decisions they make are and will continue to be the better for it.</p>

<p>Are you old enough to remember the old Peanuts cartoons? The main character, Charlie Brown, was the stereotypical lovable loser. The narrative structure was set up so we would root for him even as he failed, struggled and felt sorry for himself. It was a comfortable formula that we could all identify with in ways small and large.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently referred to another of our friends as Charlie Brown, further saying that he always seems to put himself in positions that end up not working out, leading him to struggle and feel sorry for himself. This was an accurate analysis of this fine fellow but, even more, is a great example of how a lack of alignment in our lives can lead to poor outcomes and a general lack of discontent.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my friend Johnny. He is a smart, nice and remarkably resilient person. However he keeps putting himself in &#8220;no-win&#8221; positions that are destined to fail from the beginning. For example, he became an entrepreneur by building a business around his core professional skillset. But he did not add the right complementary people and resources to make the business succeed and it turned into a crushing financial failure. It was not a good fit from the beginning, and either choosing that path could have been avoided or &#8211; perhaps more powerfully &#8211; proper understanding of the dynamic could have led him to make better choices that led to a true success.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the internet it has never been easier to start a business. However, starting a business and cultivating a business are very different things. Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. You need to be competent and at least somewhat comfortable with a wide range of skills, you need to be able to sell your butt off, and you need an unusual degree of comfort with risk and uncertainty. A minority of people can check off all these boxes; I myself barely qualify, and I&#8217;ve had a few successful companies. Yet by necessity or inspiration many people who aren&#8217;t generally well-suited for entrepreneurship choose it. Some succeed; more fail. But by better understanding ourselves as well as what skills and personality traits go into being successful we can make a more informed decision about whether we should go down that path, and how to proceed if we do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge believer in the power of context and information. It&#8217;s not that I want to tell people what to do; to the contrary, I want people to have the tools to make better decisions. If you can see that 23% of people like you were successful entrepreneurs while 91% of people like you were successful working instead inside a large law firm, you can make a more informed decision. Maybe you still hang out your own shingle, but at least you do so mindful of the gaps between who you are and what that context for success looks like. Rather than sort of arbitrarily flopping around based on limited information and understanding you can benefit from moving toward alignment between your essential self and a life that best fits you.</p>
<p>Seeing my friend be perpetually glum and careen into negative outcomes that are fairly predictable even to the naked eye, hurts. We want ourselves and the people in our lives to be successful, well, and happy. Helping them find alignment between their essential self and the choices they make in their life is a powerful gift.</p>

<p>Your best and most valuable employees are also the hardest to ultimately keep. That&#8217;s because the same things that make them so effective for you make them most desirable to the market and less tolerant to survive in a situation not commensurate with the high esteem they likely have for themselves. Since these are the people who create the most value for your organization this is not only frustrating but deserving of the highest strategic importance.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some tips to consider when thinking about how to best attract and retain top talent:</p>
<p>1. Make sure they are fairly compensated. The reality is that the best people know what they are capable of making, and what they are willing to take in the right situation. Trying to employ efficiency methods to constrain their compensation &#8211; a tactic which can work for younger employees and lesser performers &#8211; will surely lead top people to leave sooner or later.</p>
<p>2. Care about their development. While some of their development can and should be focused on how they benefit your company, you also need to help them grow in ways that will not clearly plug into your organization. They want to feel empowered and encouraged, not controlled and directed. Be proactive in helping them figure out where they want to go with their lives and contributing to their process of getting there.</p>
<p>3. Provide transparency. Top performers want to feel like they know what is going on, and have the ability to evaluate for themselves whether authority figures are making good decisions. You do not need to publicly share every shred of company information; what you must do is let them know that most information is available to be shared, then be prepared to share it if they ask to do so. While this seems like the potential to be a distraction, in reality an employee who is incessantly asking to see information likely isn&#8217;t the sort of high performer you want to keep anyway.</p>
<p>4. Allow them to be involved in decision making. Even if they don&#8217;t have the last word, they expect to be genuinely listened to and have their input factored into the final decision. Make sure they are in an environment and under a manager that is inviting of their input.</p>
<p>5. Trust them. These are different times, with flex hours, working from home and a remote workforce now the standard in more progressive companies and industries. The best people will often have expectations that would have seemed ridiculous even a decade ago, and very well might make you uncomfortable. Well, tough. This is the new normal. If you want to keep them and get the best out of them, you need to take a deep breath and trust them. Most high performers, and all truly exceptional employees, are deserving of your trust.</p>
<p>One easy way to think about your key employees is how you would a romantic partner. If you truly want to be with them long-term you need to invest with the relationship and &#8211; crucially &#8211; give them space, control and consideration. You must see them as their own people who will be less likely to leave if you reinforce, and even encourage, their freedom to do exactly that.</p>

<figcaption>We&#8217;ve been taught that rejection is humiliating and embarrassing. It shouldn&#8217;t be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We&#8217;ve been taught that rejection is among the most painful things we will feel in our lives. Rejection sucks. Rejection hurts. It represents failure, lack, falling short, something being wrong with you. On a list of the things we most fear or dislike, for many of us, rejection would be on that list.</p>
<p>How unfortunate.</p>
<p>Rejection is re-alignment. Rejection is validation that something didn&#8217;t fit: a partner, a job, a career path, a university. Whether you are the leaver or the leave-ee, ultimately to reject or be rejected is not a referendum on what was rejected. It is simply a process of moving both sides closer to alignment. Rather than being a bad thing, it is among the very best of things. It represents progress, better outcomes, better realities.</p>
<p>Yes, I know: some of you who have felt particular pain at one rejection or another are skeptically folding your arms and furrowing your brow. I don&#8217;t blame you. I remember my most painful rejections so very well, permanently burnt into my brain. And the pain they caused was immense. The question is: was that pain necessary, or was it a product of my unrealistic framing of the context I was in?</p>
<p>While my feelings were very valid, honestly deconstructing those moments, the framing that caused that pain was not. When I&#8217;ve had difficult break-ups, the pain I felt ultimately had little to do with me so adoring the relationships and everything to do with my ego being bruised, my expectations being shattered, my private self feeling embarrassed, and other internally constructed factors that had little bearing on whatever it was that was ending. I may have rationalized it in other ways at the time, but stripping back the constructed layers to the truth, the self-imposed nature of the pain was clear. I can&#8217;t deny that.</p>
<p>These days, when I look in the mirror I see sprouts of grey in my beard and wisps of grey in my hair. With those signs of physical age have come perspective and understanding of deeper realities. Every relationship I had that gutted me when it ended, I now look back and acknowledge that end was for the best. In most cases, I think it should have ended sooner. The two academic programs I applied to and was rejected from in my career, which made me feel foolish at the time, in retrospect I am so appreciative for. They weren&#8217;t good fits. The gatekeepers recognized that, and they kept me out. Good. What would have been lost by my spending that time in that situation?</p>
<p>Today I embrace rejection. And I am far faster to &#8211; kindly, thoughtfully, empathetically &#8211; do the rejecting. It is a good thing. It is a critical part of the process for achieving better alignment. Each of us, as individuals or organizations, have wonderful outcomes waiting for us. We also have many, many more suboptimal outcomes, ranging from still pretty good to absolutely shambolic. Lord knows we don&#8217;t need &#8220;optimal&#8221; outcomes in our lives, but we also shouldn&#8217;t blindly accept something less just because it is there. We most seek out alignment and resonance with the places, people and ways we spend our time. We should feel empowered to reject others to help them and ourselves find our right level. When we are rejected, rather than wallow in self-pity or lash out in retaliation, we should honour and respect that which rejected us &#8211; if we didn&#8217;t respect and honour them we certainly shouldn&#8217;t feel hurt by their rejection &#8211; and reflect on why there was not a fit. Thereby, we will grow and learn. Thereby, we will find our best place and selves.</p>
<p>Thereby, we will find alignment, success and satisfaction. There is nothing sad about that.</p>
