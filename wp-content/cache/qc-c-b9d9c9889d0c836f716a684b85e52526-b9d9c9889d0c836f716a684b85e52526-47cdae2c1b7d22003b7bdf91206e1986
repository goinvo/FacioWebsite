			<p>We&#8217;ve all looked at someone we work with and thought, &#8220;How can THAT person possibly make more than I do?&#8221;</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Just Rewards" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/JustRewards.jpg" alt="Just Rewards" /></p>
<figcaption>Odds are the best employee in this meeting is not making the most.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The short answer is the job market is a highly inefficient system that makes bad guesses. Because companies make so many &#8220;Russian roulette&#8221; hires they can only survive if they pay as little as possible to everyone, regardless of how effective they might be. Not only is this compensation strategy unfair to better employees, it is terrible for the employer who overpays people who contribute less and underpays people who contribute more. Ultimately, this leads to having too many overpaid poor performers. It is one reason why, almost without exception, efficiency within an enterprise steadily drops the larger that enterprise becomes.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a question of &#8220;good&#8221; people and &#8220;bad&#8221; people. The reality is almost everyone can add significant value to their employer if they are in the proper role. This has to do with alignment between:</p>
<p>- Employee and company. Is there an alignment in values, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and role. Is there alignment in skills, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and co-workers. Is there alignment in behaviours, style and energy?</p>
<p>Your &#8220;best&#8221; employees are going to have high degrees of alignment in all nine of those sub-considerations. Your &#8220;worst&#8221; employees will likely fit with three-to-five of these but be incompatible with others.</p>
<p>Next generation businesses will have a higher proportion of well aligned employees and pay them well. They will also be adept at identifying poorly aligned employees and moving them out in an efficient manner. As a result their bottom line will be much better and the people they employ (and don&#8217;t employ!) will have a much higher degree of alignment with their situation, and in general be better paid at the same time. It is the classic win-win that benefits everyone.</p>

			<p>The two things we&#8217;ve talked about so far &#8211; teaching self-understanding from a young age, and channeling students earlier into more specific courses of study &#8211; require significant changes to the existing school systems, to say nothing of the shift away from math and science as the must-have, end-all-be-all courses of study for all university-bound students. What we are going to talk about today &#8211; giving service and exploring the world &#8211; would benefit from broad adoption but is a choice any young person can make today. And, most of them should.</p>
<p>Some of us have a good idea the path we want to take when we get out of high school. Most of us don&#8217;t. More than just changing majors, many of us change schools. We don&#8217;t understand ourselves yet. We pick a big school because it&#8217;s where our father went, and we find that we don&#8217;t like the scale and pace only after we are living there and paying the sizable tuition. Or perhaps our guidance counselor channeled us into going there. Or our best friend picked first and we wanted to go the same place they were going. Or even we thought we knew what we wanted but, having lived a relatively sheltered life in the same home and city throughout our childhood, we didn&#8217;t know what would work for us at all.</p>
<p>Making an expensive choice that is likely to be wrong isn&#8217;t the best way to get our adult life started.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect to this. Here in the United States, most of our children and young adults have a very limited perspective of the world. Bombarded by biased media, programmed by the politics of our parents, and overly influenced by the immediate community that surrounds us, we have little idea what the world is really like and &#8211; consequently &#8211; our potential place in it.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Serve and Explore" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ServeandExplore.jpg" alt="Serve and Explore" /><br />
<figcaption>There&#8217;s a big world out there. Getting to know it will help us to better understand ourselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thanks to my upper middle class upbringing, I was able to take a three-week trip to India and Nepal as a 16 year old. It remains the most transformative experience of my life. Despite news images to the contrary, I vaguely thought that the world was suburban neighborhoods, abundances of food and goods, and not having to worry about your security. The bus ride after first landing in what we then called Bombay (today Mumbai) forever changed my view of the world. Immediately upon leaving the airport, as day was turning into night, there were people laying on the sides of the road. Lots of people. As in, hundreds if not thousands of people overall by the time we got to our hotel. That was only the first of many shocking experiences, from large packs of children begging for &#8220;chocolate&#8221;, to huge piles of feces and garbage in the streets, to scammers fooling tourists out of their money with vague illusions and &#8220;3-card monte&#8221;-style hustles in large number.</p>
<p>This India trip is an extreme example, but since then I&#8217;ve traveled much of the world, from the slums and congestion of Brazil to the soaring mountains of rural Austria. Each experience teaches me, crucially, something important. Taken altogether, what I&#8217;ve learned without question, is that what JFK once so famously said is true:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children&#8217;s future. And we are all mortal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We are all very, very different yet we share the powerful, essential similarities cited by JFK. The cultures, beliefs and lifestyles we each have are radically different. Not only does experiencing this first-hand make these facts actually palpable and realized, it allows us to incorporate these realities deeply into our worldview and understanding. In the process, we get a great deal closer to finding ourselves.</p>
<p>So, back to serve and explore. The model that high school sophomores and juniors in today&#8217;s late starting, unchanneled world should know where they want to go to school and at least approximately what kind of program they want to go into is silly. Not only do they not know themselves very well, but they know very little about everyone else. Spending a year or two giving overseas service &#8211; be it military, civic or charitable &#8211; provides an essential window into the broader world beyond what we know in our privileged communities, and exposes us to practical, real-world skills that have relationships to jobs, industries and careers. They allow us to move beyond the books and the lectures and see what it is like to be part of a functioning system of professionals. Service in general but overseas in particular, at the point in our life where our foundation has been built and we are getting ready to blast off from that platform and into our adulthood, uniquely enables us to understand more about the world and ourselves, in ways that not only give us a better start but ultimately facilitate a better life.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m glad to be alive in this day and age. My skills are generally intellectual and persuasive in nature, and they lend themselves to a knowledge economy and democratic openness. The way &#8220;the system&#8221; is built aligns pretty well with who I am. In secondary school I was identified as someone talented and a high achiever. My skills were celebrated and I received considerable validation from teachers and other administrators.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Getting a better start" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ChannelEarly.jpg" alt="Channel Early" /></p>
<figcaption>Our education system is a hammer that thinks everyone one of us is a nail. Surely, we are not.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the other hand were the lower performing students. Saddled with poor grades and branded with negative connotations, these students were taking generally the same program of study I was, yet it was clear that they were unlikely to be participants in the knowledge economy. Now, 20 years removed from high school, some of these specific peers have settled into jobs as auto mechanics, carpenters and factory workers. 1,000 years ago they would have become apprentices in a trade at a young age and received deep cultural respect; today, they were forced through an educational system of limited value to them. In the process they were made to feel diminished and unsuccessful. They were not the problem; the problem was a system that failed to account for who they uniquely are.</p>
<p>While the difference between someone who is very intellectual and someone who is very physical in their gifts is an easy example, the greater nuance lies in those with more similarities. Take five random children and someday they will grow into specific professions. Let&#8217;s for the sake of a concrete example say that they develop into a philosopher, a movie director, a software engineer, a social worker and an administrator. At what point in their lives did they start &#8220;on the track&#8221; that led them to those outcomes? Maybe the director figured it out in junior high school, because she idolized Martin Scorsese. But the education system surely did little to support her. It clicked for the philosopher as a high school senior, when they took a course on philosophy. Most high schools don&#8217;t offer this, but he got lucky. The social worker wanted to be a nurse but realized in nursing school, which can be very expensive, it was not the right fit and started over in social work. The software engineer started taking physics in university, pretty quickly realized the career potential of software engineering, and simply changed her major. Too bad she wasn&#8217;t thinking of that as a possible career much younger, as she could have been writing code for a decade already. The administrator always vaguely knew that he wanted to &#8220;go into business&#8221; and followed the channel thru undergraduate and then an MBA. It turns out his skills really aren&#8217;t tuned for executive leadership and the MBA was thus largely a waste of money. But, he ended up approximately where he always thought he would be.</p>
<p>There are many other examples we could choose. But what is notable here is, even in the best case, how late people really figured out what they were going to do, or the fact they were not supported academically in their interests until much later. Now, imagine how much different their lives would have been if:</p>
<p>- The philosopher has been identified as a big idea person at a young age, exposed to philosophy (among other intellectual topics) before high school and takes courses more germane to that future throughout those years</p>
<p>- The movie director were given a consistent thread of courses on topics like art direction, cinematography, writing and acting, alongside some more general courses</p>
<p>- The software engineer&#8217;s aptitude for math and science were identified early, and they were exposed to those type of careers at a young age. They would take courses exposing them to the applied skills and activities of those professions &#8211; at an obviously rudimentary level &#8211; and they may have found software engineering much, much earlier</p>
<p>- The social worker&#8217;s desire to help others and work in the broad medical field were compared with their skills and preferences, rooting out that they may be best actualized by more of a counseling, person-to-person relationship instead of the hands-on medical aspects of nursing. Beyond just preparatory classes they would have avoided wasting money in nursing school</p>
<p>- The administrator could have developed a far more nuanced understanding for &#8220;being in business&#8221; as a youngster, and helped to explore different roles in the context of their skills. They would have entered university with a pretty clear vision of what business as a complicated, structural context looks like and the parts they would best fit into. They either may have enjoyed a much higher trajectory in their career as a result and made the most of their MBA program, or saved the $100,000 investment altogether</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not used to thinking about channeling our young people like this. But what they would be learning would be no less age-appropriate than the general subjects they are exposed to in school today. The difference is that, instead of blindly tossing everyone into the same generic educational path we identify their diversity of preferences, skills and desires and cultivate those to give them the best possible foundation for who they are likely to become. It is a crucial aspect to getting a better start, and you can be sure the number of people who end up on the &#8220;wrong track&#8221; out of such methods will be orders of magnitude less than the poor people currently marooned and misdirected in our current, antiquated systems.</p>

			<p><a href="http://facio.com/blog/2013/01/getting-a-better-start-introduction/" title="Read the introduction to this short series" target="_blank"></a>.</p>
<p>How old were you when you had a really crisp understanding of who you are? I was 25. I stumbled upon David Keirsey&#8217;s work, and it revealed to me &#8211; for the first time in my life &#8211; that there are structured ways of looking at and thinking about ourselves and each other. I&#8217;ve spent the next 15 years learning first about myself, then about others, and finally about the methods and frameworks in general. How old were you when you first started learning about human understanding? Have you ever really learned about it?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Begin Early" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BeginEarly.jpg" alt="Math" /></p>
<figcaption>Is learning about these things really more important than deeply understanding ourselves and one another?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is surreal that physics, calculus, European history and &#8220;Brit Lit&#8221; are core parts of our secondary school curriculum yet core aspects of the self like introversion and extraversion, or the idea of having a realistic understanding of how others see you are arcane knowledge reserved for adults who are lucky or curious enough to stumble into them. We learn very clearly what makes an apple fall to the ground but have a clumsy understanding of who we are and how we fit into the world.</p>
<p>Helping children understand who they are, and giving them language and frameworks for understanding different types of people and situations, is the most valuable knowledge we can give them. While the learnings we make in physics will benefit a miniscule percentage of our citizens, human understanding will benefit each and every one of us. While this series of articles is focused on people orienting themselves professionally &#8211; from secondary school through higher education and then onto a career &#8211; these skills also benefit us in our personal lives. And there is really no excuse not to: if we are capable of learning physics and calculus we are surely capable of some degree of inculcation in human understanding.</p>
<p>It is more than just about general education of concepts, of course. From a young age, we need to beging collecting data and documenting aspects of our development. Once there is data from a lot of people and over time, we can determine what choices people made and how successful those choices were, from a standpoint of wealth, happiness and security &#8211; among other factors. From this we will have a tapestry by which to inform our perspective of how we can best be in the world. By starting at a young age, instead of blindly thrashing until we are adults, we can have some real grounding in who and how we are from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Surely, knowing who we are is more important than memorizing the wives of Henry VIII and how each of them died.</p>
