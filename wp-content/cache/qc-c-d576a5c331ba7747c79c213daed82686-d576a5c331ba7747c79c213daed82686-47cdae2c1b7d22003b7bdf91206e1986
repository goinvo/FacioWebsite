				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Companies that talk the whole transparency talk almost always draw the line on the historically most sensitive of topics: compensation. There is a notion that compensation is too sensitive, that letting everyone know what each other makes is just going to invite problems that you really don&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>There is some merit to this line of thinking. After all, the way we compensate people is hardly a meritocracy. The nature of business requires us to get most employees at as low a rate of compensation as we possibly can, in order to keep the business healthy. In the process, it is inevitable that some people are overpaid relative to their worth, while others are underpaid. This makes employees having transparency into compensation potentially frightening. More, given the relationship some people have between their relative pay and essential self-worth, the risk can go beyond destabilizing your organization to include impacting the self-esteem of one or more of your employees. It all sounds pretty scary, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a flip side to salary transparency. For one, it promotes accountability. If your organization is generally healthy, employees won&#8217;t let others skate by, and doubly so if they are overpaid relative to their contributions. The openness of information can help you get more out of underperformers in general, but particularly those who are overpaid. Now, it will also encourage top performers who are underpaid to possibly ask for more money. But ultimately, that&#8217;s OK. Paying good people what they are worth should never be a problem; the problem is overpaying people who aren&#8217;t worth it. Another benefit can be that it helps to hasten the departure of poor performers, but if you are managing well you shouldn&#8217;t need salary transparency to accomplishÂ <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>The big picture upside to salary transparency is that it can, indeed, lead to a meritocratic workplace. This may not seem like a great idea to employers, who know that they get great deals on some of their employees, for whom their relative underpayment remains blissful ignorance. But that is the wrong way to look at it. The best companies are populated by motivated high performers. Knowing they are paid fairly is one of the characteristics of high performers. And for those poorly paid poor performers, well, they either need to be performing better or moving along. The net is transformative, as top performers thrive in an open environment and under performers are helped to change themselves or move into a situation where which they better align. It will surely be better for your business, and chances are it will ultimately be better for your people as well.</p>

<figcaption>Finding yourself</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Have you ever heard the axiom that waiting until you are 25 to get married gives you the greatest chance of happiness and success in that marriage? Like most axioms, it does not account for many other contextual things, not the least of which that each of us are unique. But 25 is a consistent number when it comes to identifying the right time to get married. From the politically conservative Focus on the Family organization (recommends 22-25) to the quantitatively driven Gallup research organization (recommending 25-27 as the best ages), to the cheeky and decidedly un-scientific Cosmo (25), that ol&#8217; 25 number keeps showing up. And, with good reason: 25 is a typical age where many of us have started getting much closer to finding ourselves. We&#8217;ve gone to college, likely left home, and have entered the workforce. We&#8217;ve experienced life as an adult and &#8211; in most cases &#8211; had one or more jobs, one or more lovers and one or more domiciles of our own. We&#8217;ve experimented with the world a bit and figured out, on our own two feet, some degree of what works for us, what does not, and how we fit into the whole thing. This process, which gives us clarity and stability around who we are, strongly positions us to choose a good partner and forge a relationship that is worthwhile. Often without intending to do so, we&#8217;ve really started understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>This notion of &#8220;finding yourself&#8221; is every bit as important in our careers. The best jobs are those where there is alignment between the company, the people around you, the roles the job will require of you, and what you enjoy and succeed at doing. The less aligned any of these things are, the more likely we will be unhappy, ineffective, and/or not stay very long &#8211; a classic lose-lose scenario.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to find myself professionally. At first, I did not take my professional life at all seriously, sleepwalking thru my BA and MA before financial pressures forced me to leave the academic path and start making more money. I am naturally energetic and eager-to-please, so for a time whenever an opportunity that seemed interesting came up I was excited to just jump right in. The good news, during this period, is I learned a lot. The bad news is I kept picking things that were not good fits, leading to the thrill of learning and success quickly turning to the frustration of not enjoying what I was doing. For me, it was also complicated by ego and wanting to be &#8220;the best&#8221; in some completely generic and generally unfocused way. These were necessary steps toward my gaining real understanding.</p>
<p>After repeating this pattern with employers it only continued when I started out as an entrepreneur. I just sort of continued on the paths that were already before me, striving forward without really stepping back and evaluating what I wanted to and really should be doing. In my case, I was actually in my late 30&#8242;s before I had a clear picture of not just what I was or was not good at, but what I really enjoyed and did not enjoy doing. That clarity &#8211; fairly recent, still &#8211; has enabled me to evolve toward a professional life that gets the most out of me while proving fulfilling in personal and professional ways. It is a path that now allows contentment and happiness to join with the previous success and effectiveness I&#8217;ve long enjoyed. It is a far better place for someone to be.</p>
<p>My situation is just one example, but finding ourselves professionally allows us to feel the most rewarded and have our overall life positively impacted by what we do even while contributing more and better for the organizations that employ us.</p>

			<p>Last week we looked at the three big questions you should be asking yourself in order to make the best choices about your career. This week we will talk about when and why you should prioritize each of them.</p>
<p>While, ideally, all three of these things would be satisfied by the position we are currently in, this degree of alignment is unfortunately uncommon in the world today. So you should focus on making sure that two of them are being met, if at all possible. Here are the three combinations, and situations compatible with each:</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing?Â What do I want from my job?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This combination removes the ambition aspect. If you are not future-focused on your professional life, or not really into &#8220;a career&#8221;, you should focus on these two things. Performing tasks every day that you enjoy or, at least, don&#8217;t mind makes &#8220;work&#8221; something more than a four-letter word. It is worth holding out for this. Then, make sure your needs are being met by your employer. We all work for different reasons. For some of us, it is all about the Benjamins. For others, it is about working with people we like and being treated with respect. Actually, it is never just one thing. But figure out what the most important things are for you and get them.</p>
<p>The bottom line with this combination is to spend your day doing things you like, and make sure you are getting the rewards and treatment you need from your employer.</p>
<p>2. What do I want to be doing?Â Where do I want my career to take me?</p>

<p>Here, you are least concerned with compensation, recognition and environmental aspects, focused on the things your job will have you do, and how it can position you for the future. In this case, you have a clear vision of where you want to go in the long run, and you are very focused on getting the experience and skills necessary to ascend to that point. While title is often important in these cases as well, you are largely foregoing a focus on compensation or ego needs in exchange for taking something you think is just what you need to advance.</p>
<p>This is a good combination for young professionals, or for people reinventing themselves mid-career, or people with highly specific professional goals. This is how interns or apprentices should be thinking, aligning their day-to-day with the future in front of them.</p>

<p>This is the most future-focused configuration, as you de-prioritize the importance of what your job asks you to do and just make sure it has you on the proper long-term career path. Salary is often particularly important to this group as growing in one&#8217;s career is usually accompanied by ratcheting up your standard of living. In other cases, incentives such as the right title to be leveraged in the future, or working with or for famous or accomplished individuals and companies are big factors in making a decision. After all, if your job is to get Stephen Spielberg&#8217;s coffee, but if you&#8217;re able to negotiate a title like &#8220;Assistant Producer&#8221; in the deal, you&#8217;ve now worked on a movie with Stephen Spielberg. Needless to say there are worse things for one&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>This is the terrain of the ambitious or just people very committed to &#8220;getting ahead&#8221; from where they are now. By focusing on that future, and your personal needs in the process, you can create the best chance to realize success.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t take this article to mean I don&#8217;t think you should try and have it all. Being mindful about these three aspects is the first step to achieving the proverbial &#8220;dream job&#8221;. However, from a practical perspective, unless your financial situation gives you no other choice, always ensure you are meeting at least two of these needs. It will help work to be a healthier part of your life, contribute to greater overall well-being, and put you in control of the impact your work has upon your life.</p>

<figcaption>Actively thinking about what you are looking for professionally will help your life better align with your needs and desires.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When thinking about your career, there are three primary tensions that must be reconciled to crate satisfaction for yourself professionally:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing?</p>
<p>I remember at the start of my career, I didn&#8217;t really care what I was doing. I just wanted to get paid! As I got more experience, it became clear what I did &#8211; or, more frequently &#8211; did not want to do. For example, I learned that did not want to be a line cook. Or fill, pack and ship boxes. Or be a legal assistant. Or be a bartender. On the other hand, I kind of liked being a ghost writer. And I REALLY loved betting on horses at the track to make money, but my conservative middle class upbringing insured that I never seriously entertained spending my professional life doing that!</p>
<p>Today, as an almost-fortysomething, I have a very clear idea of what I want to be doing and not doing. Writing, research, creative direction, executive leadership: yes. Sales, service, administration: no. Having a crisp understanding of what I do and do not want to do empowers me to make better decisions about jobs I want to take &#8211; or not.</p>
<p>2. What do I want from my job?</p>
<p>Money, title, responsibilities, benefits, perks, recognition, flex time, autonomy&#8230;the many things that aren&#8217;t literally what we do but critically frame our satisfaction in doing it. We learn that money and title are the big ones to negotiate for yet &#8211; while they are important &#8211; it is the other things that often cause us to leave or love what we are doing. As with the first point, these are very personal. For example, I am now accustomed to being an entrepreneur. For the last decade I&#8217;ve worked for myself. While I can see myself again working for someone else, now I would need some set of responsibilities, some domain over which I am the final decision maker. That&#8217;s vital to me. And far more than money or title, having that is the &#8220;dealbreaker&#8221;. It took me a long time to know that about myself. When I was younger, what I wanted out of the job was far less apparent to me and manifested in money or title. I still didn&#8217;t know myself, and that opacity also obfuscated my ability to figure out what I really wanted out of what I was doing.</p>
<p>3. Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<p>This can also be called the &#8220;ambition factor&#8221;: for those who want to be a corporate CEO, it is huge. For those who like doing illustration and don&#8217;t want to do anything else, it can be largely irrelevant. It is about looking into the future and having an idea of where you hope to later be. This is another one that changes as we grow. In my case, when I first started my career, I had no sense of a specific place I wanted my career to end up at. Once I started getting on a track, however, I got the very specific notion of running my own company. This eventually transferred to the company itself, and having ideas about what I wanted that company to be. Finally, now that I&#8217;ve &#8220;made it&#8221;, this is a very small consideration for me. I don&#8217;t have any ego needs left here. And, I&#8217;ve reached a level and stature in my career where I should be able to &#8220;get a job&#8221; that pays a lot at any point. I don&#8217;t need to keep rising to create financial protection for myself and my family. Barring a total collapse of the economy and society, I&#8217;ve done all I need to do from the standpoint of ambition.</p>
<p>Next week we will take these three factors and talk about how you can balance them in making good decisions for yourself in your own career.</p>

			<p>We&#8217;ve all looked at someone we work with and thought, &#8220;How can THAT person possibly make more than I do?&#8221;</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Just Rewards" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/JustRewards.jpg" alt="Just Rewards" /></p>
<figcaption>Odds are the best employee in this meeting is not making the most.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The short answer is the job market is a highly inefficient system that makes bad guesses. Because companies make so many &#8220;Russian roulette&#8221; hires they can only survive if they pay as little as possible to everyone, regardless of how effective they might be. Not only is this compensation strategy unfair to better employees, it is terrible for the employer who overpays people who contribute less and underpays people who contribute more. Ultimately, this leads to having too many overpaid poor performers. It is one reason why, almost without exception, efficiency within an enterprise steadily drops the larger that enterprise becomes.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a question of &#8220;good&#8221; people and &#8220;bad&#8221; people. The reality is almost everyone can add significant value to their employer if they are in the proper role. This has to do with alignment between:</p>
<p>- Employee and company. Is there an alignment in values, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and role. Is there alignment in skills, interests and energy?</p>
<p>- Employee and co-workers. Is there alignment in behaviours, style and energy?</p>
<p>Your &#8220;best&#8221; employees are going to have high degrees of alignment in all nine of those sub-considerations. Your &#8220;worst&#8221; employees will likely fit with three-to-five of these but be incompatible with others.</p>
<p>Next generation businesses will have a higher proportion of well aligned employees and pay them well. They will also be adept at identifying poorly aligned employees and moving them out in an efficient manner. As a result their bottom line will be much better and the people they employ (and don&#8217;t employ!) will have a much higher degree of alignment with their situation, and in general be better paid at the same time. It is the classic win-win that benefits everyone.</p>
