			<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Cross-generational understanding" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WakeUp.jpg" alt="Wake Up" /><br />
<figcaption>When you wake up in the morning, how do you approach your day? How did your favourite grandparent?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to my mother, her father woke up every day and said &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; That is a wonderful ideal to aspire to, especially being someone who wakes up and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have xxx on my calendar today,&#8221; or some other melancholic expression about my own emerging day. On the other hand, while I am up happily working thru my creative endeavors at 2am, in the same situation he would have long since gone to bed. Culturally his approach to and taking on of the day is certainly more attractive than mine, but what I can&#8217;t figure out is whether or not it is ultimately better. Regardless of the qualitative reality of our respective states, my bigger question is: what made me so different, and how can I be more like him?</p>
<p>The problem with this question is twofold: first, the data I have on my grandfather&#8217;s life is meager, at best. I&#8217;ve never gotten to speak with much less interview people he worked with. He was a lawyer, politician, farmer, entrepreneur and oil painter. The only stories I have about him come from his children &#8211; who, like all of us, see the past in uncertain gossamer with unrealized psychic agendas &#8211; and the many stories he told me when we spent time together in my early years. These long periods together and many far-flung stories he told were less about the essential person he was and more about vignettes from his life he thought I might find entertaining, or which he was struggling to preserve in the silicon of my mind.</p>
<p>The second issue is understanding what leads us to be who we are, in the way we are. The potential divinations of the self fall across a vast chasm of a continuum, ranging from an inherently deterministic perspective giving limited weight to &#8220;nurture&#8221; and general life forces, to another extreme where every small moment of our lives smoothed or chipped us in a way to very complexly shaped us into what and who we are. The reality is likely in the middle somewhere, but within the vastness of these extremes are so many possible ways to look at a question that lacks the proper historical data to truly assess in any event.</p>
<p>All of these barriers notwithstanding, I want to figure out if it is realistic for me to transform into someone who gets out of bed announcing &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; Does the strange brew of my nature and nurture allow for it? What enabled him to frame his days in such an optimistic way? I can piece together what little I know like any armchair behavioural psychologist. But ultimately it is a vain thought exercise. Why did my father increasingly frown as he got older, and why do I feel that same frown pulling down the corners of my own mouth? Why did my predecessors live and die happily on a farm in Germany for many hundreds of years, followed by the next four &#8211; including myself &#8211; die in places far-flung from where they were born and raised?</p>
<p>Since the path to understanding these things is a mirage, the fact I aspire to discover them can certainly be dismissed as a bit of folly. But perhaps, just maybe, the data we collect over the next many generations enables my distant progeny to look back and understand their operating dynamics in ways that unlock more range in and control of their own lives.</p>

			<p>Growing up, arranged marriage was treated as a punchline. It was presented in movies and other popular culture as an outdated, senseless tradition that sought only to control the young and run contrary to American notions of freedom.</p>
<p>To be clear: no, this article will not suggest that we go back to a world of arranged marriages. People exercising their own choice to select a life partner &#8211; or even IF they select a life partner &#8211; is the more humane approach. But it is folly to discount centuries-old traditions as ignorant and senseless; we have tossed out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Indeed, in discarding arranged marriage we did away with the valuable knowledge and experience of elders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Power of Shared Knowledge" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chairs.jpg" alt="Chairs" /><br />
<figcaption>Picking the people who will best complement you is often a matter of common sense.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is a statistical fact that people with particular similarities are more likely to have lasting, successful marriages. Similar cultural backgrounds. Similar socio-economic groups. Similar religious and spiritual grounding. Complementary personality traits. In trying to espouse American values of freedom our popular culture focused on romantic comedies with quirky, unexpected, and decidedly different boy-meets-girl stories. This cheeky brand of entertainment entirely ignored the fact that these relationships are statistically less likely to work. While, certainly, wonderful relationships come out of improbable pairings the reality is a competent old-world matchmaker would probably be more likely to give you a happy pairing. It would just be with a less exotic choice, someone more like you.</p>
<p>A lot of what we do with Facio flirts with seeming to tell people what they should do. It is not our intent. We can present data, insight, statistics, probabilities. But we can&#8217;t tell you one way or another what you should do. Those choices are yours; we just want them to be more informed. We want you to make the choices, but we want to &#8211; with our modern tools and frameworks &#8211; serve the same role the wise and experienced once served when the world was slower and smaller. This brand of shared knowledge, passed from the old to the young, has been devalued on our culture. It shouldn&#8217;t be and, to what degree we are able to contribute wisdom, we surely intend to do so.</p>

<figcaption>Don&#8217;t look at employment as a long-term trip going up. It can be many other, different things.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was recently watching a BBC documentary on the great English tailors of Savile Row. Among the many interesting stories was that of a young apprentice. He was one of the best young talents, but early in the programme he very politely made note of the fact that the stuffy, traditional gatekeepers of Savile Row did not appreciate his creative flair and corresponding aptitude for design. I immediately thought he probably wouldn&#8217;t be long on Savile Row and, sure enough, by the end of the series he had moved on to a position as a designer in a costume shop. As the show pointed out, the fact that Savile Row tailors want employees who†<em>construct</em> as opposed to†<em>design</em> will chase away most of the designers at heart, who do not have the patience to wait out a decade-plus long journey up the Savile Row ladder. The people who stay for the longer term will be those who aspire to the craft construction part of the tailoring business.</p>
<p>In my experience, many employers do not pay proper attention to the relationship between the job at hand and the desires of who they are hiring. It is easy to get taken with the prodigious talent of a young hotshot, without thinking thru the fact they will likely be bored with the relatively mundane nature of the available post six months after getting started. &#8220;Misfits&#8221; like these cause considerable consternation for the employer and employee, leading to what is often an uncomfortable break followed by stress and starting over for the employer in particular. After all, the employee at least has some new experience to take to their new job search. The employer is typically back to square one.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t the misfit; it is the poor expectations. If:</p>
<p>- The employer was thinking about fit and aware that it was likely this candidate would be a short-term fit only for the particular position, and</p>
<p>- The employee had awareness of what they were getting into, or an aware employer was framing the opportunity properly so they understand this precise role is likely just of short-term interest</p>
<p>Then both sides would go in considering the fitness more clearly. There is nothing wrong with an employee getting experience and moving on; there is nothing wrong with an employer putting someone in a position for just a short period of time to fill an area of need. Where it fails is if one or both sides don&#8217;t understand the reality of what they are getting into. However, when both parties do go into it with their eyes wide open, interesting things can happen:</p>
<p>- Avoid the situation if it would not be right for them</p>
<p>- Program the end of the employment from the very beginning, making it likely both sides will have a good feelings about the time together when it is over</p>
<p>- Proactively identify opportunities for growth in other ways within the organization, taking care of the short-term need while also gaining long-term value</p>
<p>And it all begins with an awareness of the position, the overall organization, and a realistic read of the candidate. It is easy to be dazzled by talent and project how people would do in particular positions. But if it is not a good fit for the employee, it is almost certain to end badly. Understanding this likely trajectory up front instead of stumbling into it later won&#8217;t just improve how you hire: it will positively impact your culture and absolutely show up on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Everybody wins, just thanks to your paying attention and thinking ahead.</p>

			<p>Did you know that about 90% of people report themselves as being &#8220;above average&#8221; drivers? I suspect you&#8217;re shaking your head, thinking about those poor saps while smugly smiling about being one of the REALLY above average drivers. That little bit of illusory superiority aside, our roadways are one of the most stressful and contentious contexts that we live in. And the reason is because we are all so very different, and being turned loose together in control of fast, heavy machines with a bunch of road rules that some of us follow and some of us don&#8217;t? Well. Thinking about it like that I&#8217;m suddenly surprised there aren&#8217;t more road rage incidents!</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Teams Aren't Easy" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GreatTeams.jpg" alt="Great Teams Aren't Easy" /></p>
<figcaption>The more different we are from each other, the more challenges we face to work well together. And, the more potential we have to be remarkable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Teamwork is even harder and more contentious than sharing the roadways, even though most of us are in fairly homogeneous teams. For any particular profession, many of the practitioners have personalities that share similarities. From auto workers to software engineers, from custom tailors to investment bankers, each of those professions attract very different types of men and women. Yet, despite these similarities between practitioners working together, truly getting the most out of a group of people is difficult.</p>
<p>The problem is the personal nature of working together. Issues related to title, pay, authority and control bring complicated psychological relationships to bear on the work situation. Whereas on the highways we are wrapped in shells of steel and generally function in a correspondingly impersonal way, at work we are up close and personal with each other. And even if we do happen to share a good core of personality traits with sitting next to us, the differences are intensified in highly personal issues related to professional hierarchy and compensation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why great teamwork is difficult. While many of us may share similarities as a starting point, and personality differences can be identified and coached thru, ultimately it is the psychological factors that are most personal, that have to do with our sense of status, providing for our families, and feeling actualized within the group. Just think about how much more complicated it would be to get a team of an auto worker, software engineer, custom tailor and investment banker together as opposed to four investment bankers!</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re frustrated with the people you work with every day, imagine if instead of being a relatively similar group you were thrown in with a bunch of random people from the highway.You might just drive off and never come back.</p>

			<p>We typically equate personal growth as a positive, proactive thing.†In reality, each of us are growing constantly. Not all of that growth is healthy. It doesn&#8217;t always make our lives better. It is not always good for us. And it is not always fast. But it is growth, of one kind or another.</p>
<p>I grew in very different ways during college years than many of my peers. I was already married, and by my third year had a child. My opportunities to grow socially were certainly limited and, because I was not challenged by school, I didn&#8217;t try and thus was not growing as I could have intellectually. On the other hand, I was growing in less traditional ways for a very young man: I was learning skills of patience, discipline and commitment. In my creative side projects, I was learning how to plan, manage and execute successful initiatives. Of course, while university was supposed to be my context for growth it actually provided very little. Most of my growth happened around my living in a nuclear family at a very young age. It is a path that few of my fellow college-bound peers shared. In retrospect my choices would have been different, but at least I am able to appreciate what I had.</p>
<p>We have been taught to think of growth as something specific and intentional. When you want to learn something, you take the right course or read the right book. When you want to get healthy, you follow a prescribed regiment of diet and/or exercise. When you want to improve emotionally you work with a coach or a therapist. Often these are the quickest or most efficient paths to a particular kind of growth, but they are only activated when we become aware of the choices we are making, identify some explicit context for improvement, and intentionally implement appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of making intentional choices and changes around our physical health. Diet and exercise represent enormous first world industries and are inextricably tied to our sense of self, and even self-worth. At the same time, few people bring a similar awareness to their behavioural and inter-personal selves. Yes, therapy is more mainstream and accepted than it has ever been, but more often it is a reactive effort to deal with trauma than a proactive effort to grow in the best possible way. In a business context executive coaches, and even life coaches, have a place. Many executives and rising managers have enjoyed the benefits of these engagements. But rather than companies seeing these as mission-critical investments they are the sort of thing that usually is indulged when the good times are rolling but among the first cuts when it is time to tighten our belts.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Leadership And Context" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Awareness.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" /></p>
<figcaption>Being intentional about our life and choices creates better outcomes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The choices we make each day define who we are, and who we will become. Awareness of calorie counts, fat and cholesterol have been part of our collective consciousness for over a century. Attention to how many steps we take each day, times we work out each week, and repetitions we can complete on a machine are more recent concerns largely tied to the sedentary work so many of us find ourselves in. However we still do not pay intentional, perpetual attention to our emotional and behavioural selves. We live, we reign in behaviours that are conspicuously aggressive or malignant, but for the most part we simply press forward being the person we appear to be, not striving to grow in different and more beneficial ways.</p>
<p>One of our goals with Facio is to help people live more intentionally. Everything people do is growth of one sort or another. Maybe for the better; maybe for the worse. Maybe fast and effective; maybe slow and suboptimal. The choices we make, the way we live each moment of each day, is growing us in ways we rarely have awareness of.</p>
<p>Awareness. That&#8217;s the first step. Being aware of how we behave and intersect with others surfaces opportunities to grow and mindfully work toward them. The result will be that we realize more of our best selves and almost certainly participate in more positive and productive ways with the people and organizations we care about. No matter what we will be growing in one way or another; we deserve to enjoy the benefits of growing well.</p>
