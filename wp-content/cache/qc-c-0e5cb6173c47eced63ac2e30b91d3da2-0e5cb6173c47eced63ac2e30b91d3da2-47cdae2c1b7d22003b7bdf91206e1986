			<p>Chances are you&#8217;re familiar with Abraham Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow posited that there is a sequence of prepotent needs, each of which must be satisfied before a higher level need emerges in the subject&#8217;s consciousness. Progressing from physiological, to safety, to belonging and love, to self-esteem, to self-actualization, Maslow&#8217;s theory generally rings true and &#8211; as a consequence &#8211; is a standard in beginning psychology.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you probably are not familiar with Clayton Alderfer. He advanced Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy, realizing both that the five categories were too finely grained and, more importantly, that Maslow&#8217;s notion of it being a serial continuum was inconsistent with how people actually lived. Alderfer truncated Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy into three ground of needs: Existence (physiological + safety), Relatedness (belonging and love), and Growth (self-esteem and self-actualization). This is known as ERG theory. Along with establishing that people were not completely &#8220;gated&#8221; within a lower level need until it had been moved beyond, Alderfer suggested that an inability to meet a higher level need would result in the person &#8220;doubling down&#8221; on trying to meet that need via pursuit of the lower level need. So, for example, being heartbroken (failed relatedness) might lead someone to indulge in food, drugs or sex in order to try and meet that unmet need in a different way (existence).</p>
<p>ERG theory is an improvement on Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy. The frame it provides is more fluid, and the core assumption &#8211; that we are not locked into a lower level need in a binary way until it has been moved beyond &#8211; far more consistent with both behavioural research and general common sense. </p>
<p>If you are interested in needs and motivations you will certainly come across Maslow; just make sure you also discover Alderfer&#8217;s ERG theory as &#8211; in our own research &#8211; it proves more theoretically valid as well as effective in application.</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.&#8221;  - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</em></p>
<p>Hegel was talking about wars, but the insight is relevant to everyday life. What makes dealing well with other people so difficult is that each of our perspectives and motives are &#8220;right&#8221; subjectively, &#8220;right&#8221; at least in some part small or large objectively, and the degree to which they cause trouble is in their coming into conflict with the perspectives and motives of others. I was keenly reminded of this while catching up with an old employee recently.</p>
<p>They (call him Richie) were telling me about how their most recent employment ended. From their perspective, the person responsible for managing the software project they were on the team for (call him Zane) was making poor decisions, and those decisions led to repeated failure in the eyes of the business unit. Richie decided to go over Zane&#8217;s head to his boss and explain the failures were due to Zane&#8217;s poor management. Zane&#8217;s boss, who perhaps had a closer relationship with Zane than Richie realized, told Zane about the complaint and Zane quickly fired Richie. After being fired, Richie went one level higher up in the organization about the issue, which led to a larger internal inquiry that sucked in everyone on the team. Result? Richie, who had already been fired, stayed fired. However, his co-workers validated his complaints and Zane was removed from management and demoted.</p>
<p>I only have one person&#8217;s rendition of this story, so let&#8217;s treat it is a hypothetical. Who is right and who is wrong? Consider:</p>
<p>1. Zane manages the project/team in a particular way</p>
<p>2. The project has a series of misfires and draws negative attention from the rest of the organization</p>
<p>3. Richie perceives Zane as the problem and wants to change the situation</p>
<p>4. Richie goes over Zane&#8217;s head to have the situation addressed</p>
<p>5. Zane feels blindsided to discover that Richie is trying to undermine him</p>
<p>6. Zane sees Richie as insubordinate and fires him</p>
<p>7. Richie accelerates his campaign to have Zane addressed</p>
<p>8. Zane is demoted</p>
<p>This is a typical sort of &#8220;everyday tragedy&#8221; that happens in business. Zane is managing poorly. Richie responds to that badly, neither addressing it with Zane directly or raising incremental issues instead of going nuclear. Each certainly had reasons that seemed correct to them, Zane for his managerial choices and Richie for how he attempted to work up the chain to address them. Both felt correct and justified. And yet, each also presumably felt the other was entirely unreasonable and derelict in their duty. Either or both of them may have been correct. It is a knotted mess, and the very essence of Hegel&#8217;s conception of tragedy.</p>
<p>As with most things, simple communication would likely have mitigated this entire escalation: if Richie or others had tried to address the situation more incrementally, before it become so problematic. If Richie had tried to speak with Zane first, instead of going to his boss to begin with. If Zane had seemed more open to constructive feedback, cultivating an environment of openness and growth. If Zane had used the experience as a moment of growth instead of a club to hit Richie with. Yet, the lack of these things resulted in the project experiencing repeated failures, Richie out of a job, and Zane demoted.</p>
<p>This sort of situation is all too common in business, but ultimately easy to address within the right culture. While conflicts between right and right are inevitable, there is no reason for them to devolve into tragedy.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Companies that talk the whole transparency talk almost always draw the line on the historically most sensitive of topics: compensation. There is a notion that compensation is too sensitive, that letting everyone know what each other makes is just going to invite problems that you really don&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>There is some merit to this line of thinking. After all, the way we compensate people is hardly a meritocracy. The nature of business requires us to get most employees at as low a rate of compensation as we possibly can, in order to keep the business healthy. In the process, it is inevitable that some people are overpaid relative to their worth, while others are underpaid. This makes employees having transparency into compensation potentially frightening. More, given the relationship some people have between their relative pay and essential self-worth, the risk can go beyond destabilizing your organization to include impacting the self-esteem of one or more of your employees. It all sounds pretty scary, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a flip side to salary transparency. For one, it promotes accountability. If your organization is generally healthy, employees won&#8217;t let others skate by, and doubly so if they are overpaid relative to their contributions. The openness of information can help you get more out of underperformers in general, but particularly those who are overpaid. Now, it will also encourage top performers who are underpaid to possibly ask for more money. But ultimately, that&#8217;s OK. Paying good people what they are worth should never be a problem; the problem is overpaying people who aren&#8217;t worth it. Another benefit can be that it helps to hasten the departure of poor performers, but if you are managing well you shouldn&#8217;t need salary transparency to accomplish <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>The big picture upside to salary transparency is that it can, indeed, lead to a meritocratic workplace. This may not seem like a great idea to employers, who know that they get great deals on some of their employees, for whom their relative underpayment remains blissful ignorance. But that is the wrong way to look at it. The best companies are populated by motivated high performers. Knowing they are paid fairly is one of the characteristics of high performers. And for those poorly paid poor performers, well, they either need to be performing better or moving along. The net is transformative, as top performers thrive in an open environment and under performers are helped to change themselves or move into a situation where which they better align. It will surely be better for your business, and chances are it will ultimately be better for your people as well.</p>

<figcaption>Finding yourself</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Have you ever heard the axiom that waiting until you are 25 to get married gives you the greatest chance of happiness and success in that marriage? Like most axioms, it does not account for many other contextual things, not the least of which that each of us are unique. But 25 is a consistent number when it comes to identifying the right time to get married. From the politically conservative Focus on the Family organization (recommends 22-25) to the quantitatively driven Gallup research organization (recommending 25-27 as the best ages), to the cheeky and decidedly un-scientific Cosmo (25), that ol&#8217; 25 number keeps showing up. And, with good reason: 25 is a typical age where many of us have started getting much closer to finding ourselves. We&#8217;ve gone to college, likely left home, and have entered the workforce. We&#8217;ve experienced life as an adult and &#8211; in most cases &#8211; had one or more jobs, one or more lovers and one or more domiciles of our own. We&#8217;ve experimented with the world a bit and figured out, on our own two feet, some degree of what works for us, what does not, and how we fit into the whole thing. This process, which gives us clarity and stability around who we are, strongly positions us to choose a good partner and forge a relationship that is worthwhile. Often without intending to do so, we&#8217;ve really started understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>This notion of &#8220;finding yourself&#8221; is every bit as important in our careers. The best jobs are those where there is alignment between the company, the people around you, the roles the job will require of you, and what you enjoy and succeed at doing. The less aligned any of these things are, the more likely we will be unhappy, ineffective, and/or not stay very long &#8211; a classic lose-lose scenario.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to find myself professionally. At first, I did not take my professional life at all seriously, sleepwalking thru my BA and MA before financial pressures forced me to leave the academic path and start making more money. I am naturally energetic and eager-to-please, so for a time whenever an opportunity that seemed interesting came up I was excited to just jump right in. The good news, during this period, is I learned a lot. The bad news is I kept picking things that were not good fits, leading to the thrill of learning and success quickly turning to the frustration of not enjoying what I was doing. For me, it was also complicated by ego and wanting to be &#8220;the best&#8221; in some completely generic and generally unfocused way. These were necessary steps toward my gaining real understanding.</p>
<p>After repeating this pattern with employers it only continued when I started out as an entrepreneur. I just sort of continued on the paths that were already before me, striving forward without really stepping back and evaluating what I wanted to and really should be doing. In my case, I was actually in my late 30&#8242;s before I had a clear picture of not just what I was or was not good at, but what I really enjoyed and did not enjoy doing. That clarity &#8211; fairly recent, still &#8211; has enabled me to evolve toward a professional life that gets the most out of me while proving fulfilling in personal and professional ways. It is a path that now allows contentment and happiness to join with the previous success and effectiveness I&#8217;ve long enjoyed. It is a far better place for someone to be.</p>
<p>My situation is just one example, but finding ourselves professionally allows us to feel the most rewarded and have our overall life positively impacted by what we do even while contributing more and better for the organizations that employ us.</p>

<figcaption>Transparency, real and contrived</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Fox television network in the United States recently began airing a reality television program called <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em> The premise of the show is that &#8220;brave&#8221; owners of a small company temporarily turn the management of the company over to their employees, in order for their staff to be &#8220;empowered&#8221; and make decisions to help improve the organization. There are many problems with this premise: the focus is not on real development but spectacles like all the employees seeing video ripping one another; sharing the salaries for all of the employees not for transparency but as blood-in-the-water salaciousness; the poor leadership inherent in a company that would play this contrived process out on television; the fact it is contorted to the reality show standard of &#8220;identify a small group to potentially &#8216;vote off the island&#8217;.&#8221; And, the transparency they claim to be fostering is nonsense, as the owners don&#8217;t show what they are making, just the staff that the show wants to rip each other apart. There is some sociological benefit from watching the show, but it is purely as spectacle, a look at negative traits like jealousy, insecurity, deflection and covering one&#8217;s ass.</p>
<p>Real transparency, for the right reasons, is done carefully and in the spirit of building. Watch <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em> and think about these contrasting points:</p>
<p>1. You would never record the employees under a false premise and then ambush them by showing their out-of-context clips saying negatives things about other people. Getting people to be honest and talking about issues or areas of growth needs to be done in a safe, nurturing, productive way. It is hard and takes time to evolve a culture into this mode, and rather than the impact bringing out the worst in employees it typically brings out the best.</p>
<p>2. Making change starts at the top. Healthy change incorporates bottom-up input and participation, to benefit from insights at every level of a company. But that is not achieved by throwing the situation into the laps of employees and running and hiding. It requires the ownership and leadership to lead by example, having the hard conversations and taking responsibility for the difficult things.</p>
<p>3. Planning and communication is the heart of productive transparency. Just slinging information at employees without proper framing and context can foster misunderstanding and small-minded, counter-productive behaviour. It takes time to really plan what you are doing and why, then crafting consistent and even seemingly over-communication to ensure that &#8220;transparency&#8221; has some structure and productive meaning, not just a dump of information whose relevance is obfuscated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I was excited about the idea of <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em>. Optimistically &#8211; or, better, foolishly &#8211; I thought we might have a program that provides a deep and insightful look into change management. Instead we have a program that confirms the very worst people think about reality programs that serves as a model to illustrate the wrong way to include and empower your people.</p>
