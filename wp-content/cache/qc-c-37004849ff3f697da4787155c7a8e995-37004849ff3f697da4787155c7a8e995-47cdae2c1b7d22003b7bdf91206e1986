			<p>The older I get, the more deeply I value the role of specialist coaches and consultants to get the most out of our people and organization.</p>
<p>At first, investing in a coach or consultant can seem expensive. Comparing their hourly rate to what you could hire someone for, or going down the logic trail of &#8220;I pay Bob big bucks already, if I need to pay these rates to a coach to get Bob on track then why is Bob here in the first place?&#8221; is a self-destructive exercise. Consider:</p>
<p>First, each of us have strengths and weaknesses. So it is likely that many of us are in roles where our strengths are not being optimized and our weaknesses further exposed. Or, if we are, our weaknesses are going to spring up from time-to-time. The expectation that we should just be plug-and-play effective is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Next, none of us are perfect. We have good days and bad; even good and bad weeks or months. While the &#8220;bad&#8221; periods are certainly not good for anyone &#8211; including our employer who presumably keeps paying us regardless &#8211; they should be expected. &#8220;Bob&#8221; in my above example may be struggling, but our simply expecting him to suck it up and improve since we&#8217;re paying him isn&#8217;t consistent with reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, improving and actually contributing more than we are otherwise able takes an investment. This might be an investment of time or money, but either way something different needs to happen to be a catalyst for, well, different things starting to happen! Expecting it to happen through osmosis or because someone is given a pep talk (or development plan) is scattershot and puts the success or failure outside of your hands as a manager or employer.</p>
<p>The great thing about a strong coach is that they bring the total package to the table: it is their time that goes into managing the development; it is their specialized expertise that makes the most of the development; it is their experience doing this with many other people that makes it likely the development is going to succeed.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Coaches: a smart investment" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Coach_300.jpg" alt="Coaches: a smart investment" /><br />
<figcaption>When we hear the word &#8220;coach&#8221; it might conjure up images of someone with a whistle, but professional coaches can transform your employees and business.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember an employee who once worked for me. An extremely hard-working fellow, very nice and generally capable, he just didn&#8217;t seem able to &#8220;make it happen&#8221; in the things we were expecting of him. And, we didn&#8217;t really know how to properly guide or necessarily manage him. Despite the fact he was jut the kind of person we wanted in our organization, we were frustrated with him. We talked about letting him go. We couldn&#8217;t understand why he didn&#8217;t just &#8220;make it happen.&#8221; Instead of letting our frustration take us to the point of letting him go, we doubled down and provided him with a coach. He immediately began to excel. The coach&#8217;s combination of management attention and domain-specific guidance and expertise was transformative. Not only did his performance significantly improve, the coach told us he&#8217;s one of the strongest employees he&#8217;s ever worked with, an absolute model.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#8217;t made the investment in the coach, it would have ended very differently. And, we paid less for the coach than paying a recruiter to replace our employee &#8211; with someone who likely would not have been the same kind of star &#8211; would have cost. Literally everyone won as the company&#8217;s bottom line benefitted, our culture was burgeoned from re-investing in someone everyone liked, and the employee&#8217;s potential was fully unlocked in way that were not just beneficial to success in his role but also to him personally.</p>
<p>This is just one example, but it really illustrates the power a good coach can have. Yes, the hourly rate might seem high. Yes, our intuition might be that the employee should just &#8220;suck it up&#8221; and &#8220;get the job done&#8221;. These are just bad excuses. The investment in a good coach or consultant is an investment of vision. It is one of those uncommon things that is likely to have a positive impact on both your short-term bottom line and your long-term culture and employee wellness. If you have an employee who is generally a good fit, double-down on unlocking their potential.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m going to turn 40 this year. Beyond symbolically being &#8220;in the middle&#8221;, it puts me square in the middle of two very different ways of looking at the work world.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="People Leave" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PeopleLeave.jpg" alt="People Leave" /><br />
<figcaption>Trying to prevent people from leaving, or punishing them for doing so, is a sign of poor management.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I grew up being taught that you should find a good company, give them your best effort for 40&#8242;ish years, be well rewarded, then retire and live The Good Life of laying around and taking up a hobby. The reality of today&#8217;s workplace is that people search for opportunities that provide the right experience and/or lifestyle, then are quick to seek out and move into positions elsewhere that are better fits for the life they want to live. It took me a couple of jobs to shift from seeing work as &#8220;married forever&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s mostly about me&#8221;. The changes are a good thing, but some of our thinking remains mired in the older, outmoded ways.</p>
<p>Recently one of my employees left Facio. He was an outstanding contributor and very strong cultural fit. However, another company more mature than us recognized his excellence and offered him 50% more salary and going from overseeing a team of two others to overseeing a team of 30 others. It greatly accelerated his career arc, and more rapidly put him in a position that aligned with the breadth of impact he wants to have. While terribly disappointed to lose him, I was thrilled for the chance he was being given.</p>
<p>Often times we do not have that open-minded reaction. More than once, I&#8217;ve seen reactions to an announced departure range from anger to betrayal to disgust. Not only does it not honour the person who is leaving, it is entirely counter-productive. Other employees seeing an adverse reaction to a departure are learning how the employer treats other employees, and take for granted they may be subjected to the same negativity. It lowers morale, decreases loyalty and can have a chilling impact on the environment. Treating people positively and supportively is better for your company, better for them, and ultimately better for you. Positive emotions are proven to increase the quality and length of our lives.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: people leave. Sometimes you want them to; other times you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you are surprised; other times you see it coming. Sometimes they are leaving at a clean and comfortable moment; other times it is exceedingly messy and inconvenient. Regardless of the particular circumstances, expecting that people are (all!) going to leave should be a given, and making their departure as positive it can be given the specific circumstances is the best thing you can do in your role for your employer and for yourself as a citizen.</p>

<figcaption>A little bit of training and discipline when a new employee starts can go a long way to making their tenure with you a success.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not enough attention or investment is paid to training new employees. Well-orchestrated and properly designed training is proven to increase retention. More than that, it creates alignment between the new hire and the expectations of the company, management and their particular position. It also is the best time to get an employee&#8217;s behaviour to shift from their past or natural inclinations into what your organization needs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the phrase &#8220;honeymoon phase&#8221;. This is the period when a person &#8211; whether in a new job or new relationship &#8211; is behaving aspirationally and trying to adapt to better fit with their opposite. Not only is it the time when you see more of the &#8220;best self&#8221; of a person, it is when they are most susceptible to training and change.</p>
<p>You have a short period of time after a new employee comes to teach them new things that require big behavior change and make it stick. Even if someone doesn&#8217;t like process &#8211; say, using Salesforce.com to track their sales activity &#8211; you can often get them on board and using it if you get them on it early and turn it into a habit. On the other hand, when you have an employee who has been working at your company without that discipline for a long time and then you try to get them on it, it is much harder.</p>
<p>Being sure to train new employees just makes sense. We invest our time and money in finding and closing new talent; shouldn&#8217;t we do our best to make their tenure as long and productive as possible? It&#8217;s a no brainer.</p>

<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Picking a Job That Fits" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/JobThatFits.jpg" alt="Phone" /></p>
<figcaption>We often rush to find a new job in order to pay the bills. This can lead to poor job fit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of us have been in a &#8220;bad job&#8221; before. Some of us more than once. Some of us, even as you are reading this! There are two general reasons why we end up in bad jobs: first, we need the income from our jobs in order to pay our bills and be a respected and participating member of society. In many cases, this makes us anxious to get A job, not choosy enough to hold out for THE job. Secondly, a general lack of understanding leads us into bad choices. Not understanding ourselves, not understanding the position or company, not understanding our manager or co-workers there. Most of the time when we take a new job we do so with only partial information. To some degree it is just a product of luck whether or not you happen into a good or bad job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Facio is focused on the second of these issues, the problem of understanding, I want to focus today on the first: the pressure we are under to have a regular income. When we are between jobs, the pressure to find the next thing can be tremendous. More than just the financial pressure, we might be feeling rejected if we were let go from our previous job. Or, we might be hungry to begin showing a new employer how truly excellent we really are. Regardless of which of these motives are propelling our job search, it is underpinned by the unknown. We don&#8217;t know how many offers we are going to get. Or even if we are going to get offers. This leads us to try and twist ourselves to look attractive to each prospective employer we meet with, and get them to &#8220;say yes&#8221; to us. Once they do, we can be quick to say &#8220;yes&#8221; because it puts us into a position of perceived safety again. The uncertainty is over. We don&#8217;t need to worry if we&#8217;re going to get another offer. Someone wants us, and the financial and psychological pressures can all be released.</p>
<p>The problem is that the first job that wants us isn&#8217;t necessarily the right one. Imagine if we treated our romantic relationships that way, that the first person to show an interest in being with us we sign a contract and move in with one another. It sounds silly, but that is what we are often doing when we take a new job. The research we do is circumspect. We go to the interviews, we dance and sing, we give them our three best references who are also personal friends and will make us sound like superstars. But our research into the position and the people we would be working with is rarely so thorough. We&#8217;re just happy that they said &#8220;yes&#8221;. We can stop paying our rent out of savings; we can begin redeeming ourselves from that bad last position.</p>
<p>Over our adult lives we will spend more than a quarter of our lives working. That is a large chunk. We need to view our jobs and employers during that time as needing to align with who we are. The tasks we do should either be helping us learn or be something we enjoy. The people we work with should be compatible with who we are and how e function. The companies we work for should have values and impact that resonate with our authentic selves. The pull to simply make sure that someone, anyone accepts us is a strong one. The financial pressure is very real, and the psychological pressure feels pointed as well. But picking the wrong position is ultimately a significant negative. Not only does it waste the moments of our lives, it ostensibly will end up with our uncomfortably leaving yet another position and going back on the hunt yet again.</p>
<p>As wise craftsmen sagely espouse, measuring twice and cutting once might seem to take a little longer. but it ultimately results in better outcomes.</p>

<figcaption>We may not get along, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the other person is broken.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of us assign moral failing to others who are different than us. The networker who flits their way around the social event is “superficial”. The quiet person who stays in the corner and doesn’t have much to say is “boring”. The loud person performing for a group not sensitive to the noise and space needs of people around them is “obnoxious”. The intellectual who has a critical word for seemingly everything is “arrogant”.</p>
<p>Diminishing others with such language and framing is a huge mistake that we almost universally make. We attribute to their <em>character</em> what are actually facets of their <em>inherent personality</em>. Sure, it is much easier to translate the discomfort they make us feel into some failing on their part. However, most of the time, it is not a failing by either party and instead an incompatibility between them. Indeed, each of us know other people who we “can’t stand”, yet sure enough they have friends, family, people who like and trust them. The problem isn’t them, it is the intersection between who we are, and who they are.</p>
<p>This stretches beyond personality as well. Sometimes the issue is one of territory. There can only be one CEO, so people who otherwise would get along begin seeing one another negatively because their ambitions are contradictory. Other times the issue is one of time: I am in a hurry and the other person is not. This creates conflict as we try to accomplish different things in different ways. Most of the time, in all of these cases, we turn that friction between us into a judgement of the other person. We objectify and diminish them, rather than saving blame and viewing the situation more objectively. After all, when someone blocks us or makes us feel uncomfortable, it is easier and more cathartic to say “What an a-hole!” instead of, “Ah, he’s just an extraverted intuitive.”</p>
<p>To improve your mental health and capacity for bringing goodness to the world, be aware of these judgement that you make as you go thru life. Turn the aspersions toward the other person into a recognition that you just aren’t lining up with each other. That might make you uncomfortable, but it surely does not make them bad.</p>
