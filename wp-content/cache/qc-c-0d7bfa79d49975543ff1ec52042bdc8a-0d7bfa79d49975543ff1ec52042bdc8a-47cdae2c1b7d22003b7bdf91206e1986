<figcaption>Don&#8217;t look at employment as a long-term trip going up. It can be many other, different things.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was recently watching a BBC documentary on the great English tailors of Savile Row. Among the many interesting stories was that of a young apprentice. He was one of the best young talents, but early in the programme he very politely made note of the fact that the stuffy, traditional gatekeepers of Savile Row did not appreciate his creative flair and corresponding aptitude for design. I immediately thought he probably wouldn&#8217;t be long on Savile Row and, sure enough, by the end of the series he had moved on to a position as a designer in a costume shop. As the show pointed out, the fact that Savile Row tailors want employees who†<em>construct</em> as opposed to†<em>design</em> will chase away most of the designers at heart, who do not have the patience to wait out a decade-plus long journey up the Savile Row ladder. The people who stay for the longer term will be those who aspire to the craft construction part of the tailoring business.</p>
<p>In my experience, many employers do not pay proper attention to the relationship between the job at hand and the desires of who they are hiring. It is easy to get taken with the prodigious talent of a young hotshot, without thinking thru the fact they will likely be bored with the relatively mundane nature of the available post six months after getting started. &#8220;Misfits&#8221; like these cause considerable consternation for the employer and employee, leading to what is often an uncomfortable break followed by stress and starting over for the employer in particular. After all, the employee at least has some new experience to take to their new job search. The employer is typically back to square one.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t the misfit; it is the poor expectations. If:</p>
<p>- The employer was thinking about fit and aware that it was likely this candidate would be a short-term fit only for the particular position, and</p>
<p>- The employee had awareness of what they were getting into, or an aware employer was framing the opportunity properly so they understand this precise role is likely just of short-term interest</p>
<p>Then both sides would go in considering the fitness more clearly. There is nothing wrong with an employee getting experience and moving on; there is nothing wrong with an employer putting someone in a position for just a short period of time to fill an area of need. Where it fails is if one or both sides don&#8217;t understand the reality of what they are getting into. However, when both parties do go into it with their eyes wide open, interesting things can happen:</p>
<p>- Avoid the situation if it would not be right for them</p>
<p>- Program the end of the employment from the very beginning, making it likely both sides will have a good feelings about the time together when it is over</p>
<p>- Proactively identify opportunities for growth in other ways within the organization, taking care of the short-term need while also gaining long-term value</p>
<p>And it all begins with an awareness of the position, the overall organization, and a realistic read of the candidate. It is easy to be dazzled by talent and project how people would do in particular positions. But if it is not a good fit for the employee, it is almost certain to end badly. Understanding this likely trajectory up front instead of stumbling into it later won&#8217;t just improve how you hire: it will positively impact your culture and absolutely show up on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Everybody wins, just thanks to your paying attention and thinking ahead.</p>

			<p>Did you know that about 90% of people report themselves as being &#8220;above average&#8221; drivers? I suspect you&#8217;re shaking your head, thinking about those poor saps while smugly smiling about being one of the REALLY above average drivers. That little bit of illusory superiority aside, our roadways are one of the most stressful and contentious contexts that we live in. And the reason is because we are all so very different, and being turned loose together in control of fast, heavy machines with a bunch of road rules that some of us follow and some of us don&#8217;t? Well. Thinking about it like that I&#8217;m suddenly surprised there aren&#8217;t more road rage incidents!</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Teams Aren't Easy" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GreatTeams.jpg" alt="Great Teams Aren't Easy" /></p>
<figcaption>The more different we are from each other, the more challenges we face to work well together. And, the more potential we have to be remarkable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Teamwork is even harder and more contentious than sharing the roadways, even though most of us are in fairly homogeneous teams. For any particular profession, many of the practitioners have personalities that share similarities. From auto workers to software engineers, from custom tailors to investment bankers, each of those professions attract very different types of men and women. Yet, despite these similarities between practitioners working together, truly getting the most out of a group of people is difficult.</p>
<p>The problem is the personal nature of working together. Issues related to title, pay, authority and control bring complicated psychological relationships to bear on the work situation. Whereas on the highways we are wrapped in shells of steel and generally function in a correspondingly impersonal way, at work we are up close and personal with each other. And even if we do happen to share a good core of personality traits with sitting next to us, the differences are intensified in highly personal issues related to professional hierarchy and compensation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why great teamwork is difficult. While many of us may share similarities as a starting point, and personality differences can be identified and coached thru, ultimately it is the psychological factors that are most personal, that have to do with our sense of status, providing for our families, and feeling actualized within the group. Just think about how much more complicated it would be to get a team of an auto worker, software engineer, custom tailor and investment banker together as opposed to four investment bankers!</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re frustrated with the people you work with every day, imagine if instead of being a relatively similar group you were thrown in with a bunch of random people from the highway.You might just drive off and never come back.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>We typically equate personal growth as a positive, proactive thing.†In reality, each of us are growing constantly. Not all of that growth is healthy. It doesn&#8217;t always make our lives better. It is not always good for us. And it is not always fast. But it is growth, of one kind or another.</p>
<p>I grew in very different ways during college years than many of my peers. I was already married, and by my third year had a child. My opportunities to grow socially were certainly limited and, because I was not challenged by school, I didn&#8217;t try and thus was not growing as I could have intellectually. On the other hand, I was growing in less traditional ways for a very young man: I was learning skills of patience, discipline and commitment. In my creative side projects, I was learning how to plan, manage and execute successful initiatives. Of course, while university was supposed to be my context for growth it actually provided very little. Most of my growth happened around my living in a nuclear family at a very young age. It is a path that few of my fellow college-bound peers shared. In retrospect my choices would have been different, but at least I am able to appreciate what I had.</p>
<p>We have been taught to think of growth as something specific and intentional. When you want to learn something, you take the right course or read the right book. When you want to get healthy, you follow a prescribed regiment of diet and/or exercise. When you want to improve emotionally you work with a coach or a therapist. Often these are the quickest or most efficient paths to a particular kind of growth, but they are only activated when we become aware of the choices we are making, identify some explicit context for improvement, and intentionally implement appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of making intentional choices and changes around our physical health. Diet and exercise represent enormous first world industries and are inextricably tied to our sense of self, and even self-worth. At the same time, few people bring a similar awareness to their behavioural and inter-personal selves. Yes, therapy is more mainstream and accepted than it has ever been, but more often it is a reactive effort to deal with trauma than a proactive effort to grow in the best possible way. In a business context executive coaches, and even life coaches, have a place. Many executives and rising managers have enjoyed the benefits of these engagements. But rather than companies seeing these as mission-critical investments they are the sort of thing that usually is indulged when the good times are rolling but among the first cuts when it is time to tighten our belts.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Leadership And Context" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Awareness.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" /></p>
<figcaption>Being intentional about our life and choices creates better outcomes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The choices we make each day define who we are, and who we will become. Awareness of calorie counts, fat and cholesterol have been part of our collective consciousness for over a century. Attention to how many steps we take each day, times we work out each week, and repetitions we can complete on a machine are more recent concerns largely tied to the sedentary work so many of us find ourselves in. However we still do not pay intentional, perpetual attention to our emotional and behavioural selves. We live, we reign in behaviours that are conspicuously aggressive or malignant, but for the most part we simply press forward being the person we appear to be, not striving to grow in different and more beneficial ways.</p>
<p>One of our goals with Facio is to help people live more intentionally. Everything people do is growth of one sort or another. Maybe for the better; maybe for the worse. Maybe fast and effective; maybe slow and suboptimal. The choices we make, the way we live each moment of each day, is growing us in ways we rarely have awareness of.</p>
<p>Awareness. That&#8217;s the first step. Being aware of how we behave and intersect with others surfaces opportunities to grow and mindfully work toward them. The result will be that we realize more of our best selves and almost certainly participate in more positive and productive ways with the people and organizations we care about. No matter what we will be growing in one way or another; we deserve to enjoy the benefits of growing well.</p>

<figcaption>Finding alignment leads you to success &#8211; if only Charlie knew!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Are you old enough to remember the old Peanuts cartoons? The main character, Charlie Brown, was the stereotypical lovable loser. The narrative structure was set up so we would root for him even as he failed, struggled and felt sorry for himself. It was a comfortable formula that we could all identify with in ways small and large.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently referred to another of our friends as Charlie Brown, further saying that he always seems to put himself in positions that end up not working out, leading him to struggle and feel sorry for himself. This was an accurate analysis of this fine fellow but, even more, is a great example of how a lack of alignment in our lives can lead to poor outcomes and a general lack of discontent.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my friend Johnny. He is a smart, nice and remarkably resilient person. However he keeps putting himself in &#8220;no-win&#8221; positions that are destined to fail from the beginning. For example, he became an entrepreneur by building a business around his core professional skillset. But he did not add the right complementary people and resources to make the business succeed and it turned into a crushing financial failure. It was not a good fit from the beginning, and either choosing that path could have been avoided or &#8211; perhaps more powerfully &#8211; proper understanding of the dynamic could have led him to make better choices that led to a true success.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the internet it has never been easier to start a business. However, starting a business and cultivating a business are very different things. Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. You need to be competent and at least somewhat comfortable with a wide range of skills, you need to be able to sell your butt off, and you need an unusual degree of comfort with risk and uncertainty. A minority of people can check off all these boxes; I myself barely qualify, and I&#8217;ve had a few successful companies. Yet by necessity or inspiration many people who aren&#8217;t generally well-suited for entrepreneurship choose it. Some succeed; more fail. But by better understanding ourselves as well as what skills and personality traits go into being successful we can make a more informed decision about whether we should go down that path, and how to proceed if we do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge believer in the power of context and information. It&#8217;s not that I want to tell people what to do; to the contrary, I want people to have the tools to make better decisions. If you can see that 23% of people like you were successful entrepreneurs while 91% of people like you were successful working instead inside a large law firm, you can make a more informed decision. Maybe you still hang out your own shingle, but at least you do so mindful of the gaps between who you are and what that context for success looks like. Rather than sort of arbitrarily flopping around based on limited information and understanding you can benefit from moving toward alignment between your essential self and a life that best fits you.</p>
<p>Seeing my friend be perpetually glum and careen into negative outcomes that are fairly predictable even to the naked eye, hurts. We want ourselves and the people in our lives to be successful, well, and happy. Helping them find alignment between their essential self and the choices they make in their life is a powerful gift.</p>

<figcaption>This woman might be perfect for you, but she would be terrible for me.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every day it becomes more clear to me that the daily ways we judge things as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; are inappropriate. While graduate school taught me the idea†<em>contextual</em>, functionally speaking that needs to extend to†<em>alignment</em>, or how well two or more things actually fit with each other.</p>
<p>I think my wife is terrific. In fact, removing all of the love and emotion I have for her from the equation, I struggle to imagine how someone else would functionally be a better fit for me. Now, I know very well she would not be similarly suited for every man. It just happens that her unique bend of strengths and weaknesses fit with mine in a way that provides a happy and satisfying life. We are incredibly well-aligned. There are other women who might objectively be &#8220;rated&#8221; as more desirable partners by other men. This has no relevance to me. What is important is that I found someone who fits ME. I might, because we&#8217;ve been taught to speak this way, say that &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the best wife!&#8221; But it really isn&#8217;t what I mean, nor would it be true. What I really mean is &#8220;My wife is fantastic, she is really great for ME.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thinking about and eventually re-framing the world this way is freeing. Instead of seeing jobs and people as &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; based on our framing and perception of them, it is just a question of what fits for each of us. Sure, I have personal beliefs that certain ways of behaving &#8211; eating healthier foods, treating people well, avoiding hierarchy and patriarchy in companies &#8211; are objectively better than others. And I want to espouse those things in order to, in my opinion, help people live more full, well and meaningful lives. But allowing this to saturate my worldview, and framing others in positive and negative ways is as destructive as the negative things my personal beliefs are attempting to improve.</p>
<p>For example, I pretty much think Burger King is scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of what people should be eating, for reasons of both taste and health. But, y&#8217;know, for reasons of budget or convenience or taste or just random compulsion, Burger King might be just the right thing for someone else. In that moment, for who they are and what their needs are, it fits. There is alignment between the person and that particular experience.</p>
<p>So where am I going with all of this? After all, Facio is explicitly a service endeavouring to help people achieve better outcomes, and with a particular framing of what better and worse ways of living look like. The secret here is simply shifting from the polarizing, black-and-white language and conceptions we see in partisan politics and the media to a tolerance and even acceptance of the way things and people are. Seeing my friend Baroo walk into our gaming group with a bag of Burger King and thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he is eating that crap&#8221; is counterproductive. Heckling him about it could even be destructive. It does not contribute to moving him toward what I would consider more healthy and positive outcomes. It achieves the opposite by encouraging him to defend his choice publicly and further justify it internally. After all, it represents his choice and for reasons both good and bad literally represents alignment between him and that food from Burger King. In that moment he has made his choice and it fit for him. The best way to try and change that is to make my own choice and, through living it positively and confidently, communicating a different path to him.</p>
<p>People find themselves in a remarkable diversity of moments and situations that, while more often unhealthy or suboptimal in some objective sense, correct and appropriate for who they are at the moment. There is alignment. When there is alignment between ourselves and the people, organizations and things in our life we are happier and more productive. Sure, there is a potential &#8220;better&#8221; out there for us. As John Lennon once wisely said, life is what happens while we&#8217;re busy making other plans. By accepting the present &#8211; even if and as we strive for a better future &#8211; and embracing and accepting alignment in the moment we will most certainly better from it. It is not about being best or correct; it is about what fits and works. Live on!</p>
