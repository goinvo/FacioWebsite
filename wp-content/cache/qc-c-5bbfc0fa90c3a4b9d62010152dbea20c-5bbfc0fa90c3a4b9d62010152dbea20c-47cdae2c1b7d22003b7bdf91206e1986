<figcaption>We may not get along, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the other person is broken.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of us assign moral failing to others who are different than us. The networker who flits their way around the social event is “superficial”. The quiet person who stays in the corner and doesn’t have much to say is “boring”. The loud person performing for a group not sensitive to the noise and space needs of people around them is “obnoxious”. The intellectual who has a critical word for seemingly everything is “arrogant”.</p>
<p>Diminishing others with such language and framing is a huge mistake that we almost universally make. We attribute to their <em>character</em> what are actually facets of their <em>inherent personality</em>. Sure, it is much easier to translate the discomfort they make us feel into some failing on their part. However, most of the time, it is not a failing by either party and instead an incompatibility between them. Indeed, each of us know other people who we “can’t stand”, yet sure enough they have friends, family, people who like and trust them. The problem isn’t them, it is the intersection between who we are, and who they are.</p>
<p>This stretches beyond personality as well. Sometimes the issue is one of territory. There can only be one CEO, so people who otherwise would get along begin seeing one another negatively because their ambitions are contradictory. Other times the issue is one of time: I am in a hurry and the other person is not. This creates conflict as we try to accomplish different things in different ways. Most of the time, in all of these cases, we turn that friction between us into a judgement of the other person. We objectify and diminish them, rather than saving blame and viewing the situation more objectively. After all, when someone blocks us or makes us feel uncomfortable, it is easier and more cathartic to say “What an a-hole!” instead of, “Ah, he’s just an extraverted intuitive.”</p>
<p>To improve your mental health and capacity for bringing goodness to the world, be aware of these judgement that you make as you go thru life. Turn the aspersions toward the other person into a recognition that you just aren’t lining up with each other. That might make you uncomfortable, but it surely does not make them bad.</p>

			<p>Growing up, arranged marriage was treated as a punchline. It was presented in movies and other popular culture as an outdated, senseless tradition that sought only to control the young and run contrary to American notions of freedom.</p>
<p>To be clear: no, this article will not suggest that we go back to a world of arranged marriages. People exercising their own choice to select a life partner &#8211; or even IF they select a life partner &#8211; is the more humane approach. But it is folly to discount centuries-old traditions as ignorant and senseless; we have tossed out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Indeed, in discarding arranged marriage we did away with the valuable knowledge and experience of elders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Power of Shared Knowledge" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chairs.jpg" alt="Chairs" /><br />
<figcaption>Picking the people who will best complement you is often a matter of common sense.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is a statistical fact that people with particular similarities are more likely to have lasting, successful marriages. Similar cultural backgrounds. Similar socio-economic groups. Similar religious and spiritual grounding. Complementary personality traits. In trying to espouse American values of freedom our popular culture focused on romantic comedies with quirky, unexpected, and decidedly different boy-meets-girl stories. This cheeky brand of entertainment entirely ignored the fact that these relationships are statistically less likely to work. While, certainly, wonderful relationships come out of improbable pairings the reality is a competent old-world matchmaker would probably be more likely to give you a happy pairing. It would just be with a less exotic choice, someone more like you.</p>
<p>A lot of what we do with Facio flirts with seeming to tell people what they should do. It is not our intent. We can present data, insight, statistics, probabilities. But we can&#8217;t tell you one way or another what you should do. Those choices are yours; we just want them to be more informed. We want you to make the choices, but we want to &#8211; with our modern tools and frameworks &#8211; serve the same role the wise and experienced once served when the world was slower and smaller. This brand of shared knowledge, passed from the old to the young, has been devalued on our culture. It shouldn&#8217;t be and, to what degree we are able to contribute wisdom, we surely intend to do so.</p>

<figcaption>Don&#8217;t look at employment as a long-term trip going up. It can be many other, different things.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was recently watching a BBC documentary on the great English tailors of Savile Row. Among the many interesting stories was that of a young apprentice. He was one of the best young talents, but early in the programme he very politely made note of the fact that the stuffy, traditional gatekeepers of Savile Row did not appreciate his creative flair and corresponding aptitude for design. I immediately thought he probably wouldn&#8217;t be long on Savile Row and, sure enough, by the end of the series he had moved on to a position as a designer in a costume shop. As the show pointed out, the fact that Savile Row tailors want employees who†<em>construct</em> as opposed to†<em>design</em> will chase away most of the designers at heart, who do not have the patience to wait out a decade-plus long journey up the Savile Row ladder. The people who stay for the longer term will be those who aspire to the craft construction part of the tailoring business.</p>
<p>In my experience, many employers do not pay proper attention to the relationship between the job at hand and the desires of who they are hiring. It is easy to get taken with the prodigious talent of a young hotshot, without thinking thru the fact they will likely be bored with the relatively mundane nature of the available post six months after getting started. &#8220;Misfits&#8221; like these cause considerable consternation for the employer and employee, leading to what is often an uncomfortable break followed by stress and starting over for the employer in particular. After all, the employee at least has some new experience to take to their new job search. The employer is typically back to square one.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t the misfit; it is the poor expectations. If:</p>
<p>- The employer was thinking about fit and aware that it was likely this candidate would be a short-term fit only for the particular position, and</p>
<p>- The employee had awareness of what they were getting into, or an aware employer was framing the opportunity properly so they understand this precise role is likely just of short-term interest</p>
<p>Then both sides would go in considering the fitness more clearly. There is nothing wrong with an employee getting experience and moving on; there is nothing wrong with an employer putting someone in a position for just a short period of time to fill an area of need. Where it fails is if one or both sides don&#8217;t understand the reality of what they are getting into. However, when both parties do go into it with their eyes wide open, interesting things can happen:</p>
<p>- Avoid the situation if it would not be right for them</p>
<p>- Program the end of the employment from the very beginning, making it likely both sides will have a good feelings about the time together when it is over</p>
<p>- Proactively identify opportunities for growth in other ways within the organization, taking care of the short-term need while also gaining long-term value</p>
<p>And it all begins with an awareness of the position, the overall organization, and a realistic read of the candidate. It is easy to be dazzled by talent and project how people would do in particular positions. But if it is not a good fit for the employee, it is almost certain to end badly. Understanding this likely trajectory up front instead of stumbling into it later won&#8217;t just improve how you hire: it will positively impact your culture and absolutely show up on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Everybody wins, just thanks to your paying attention and thinking ahead.</p>

<figcaption>Finding alignment leads you to success &#8211; if only Charlie knew!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Are you old enough to remember the old Peanuts cartoons? The main character, Charlie Brown, was the stereotypical lovable loser. The narrative structure was set up so we would root for him even as he failed, struggled and felt sorry for himself. It was a comfortable formula that we could all identify with in ways small and large.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently referred to another of our friends as Charlie Brown, further saying that he always seems to put himself in positions that end up not working out, leading him to struggle and feel sorry for himself. This was an accurate analysis of this fine fellow but, even more, is a great example of how a lack of alignment in our lives can lead to poor outcomes and a general lack of discontent.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my friend Johnny. He is a smart, nice and remarkably resilient person. However he keeps putting himself in &#8220;no-win&#8221; positions that are destined to fail from the beginning. For example, he became an entrepreneur by building a business around his core professional skillset. But he did not add the right complementary people and resources to make the business succeed and it turned into a crushing financial failure. It was not a good fit from the beginning, and either choosing that path could have been avoided or &#8211; perhaps more powerfully &#8211; proper understanding of the dynamic could have led him to make better choices that led to a true success.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the internet it has never been easier to start a business. However, starting a business and cultivating a business are very different things. Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. You need to be competent and at least somewhat comfortable with a wide range of skills, you need to be able to sell your butt off, and you need an unusual degree of comfort with risk and uncertainty. A minority of people can check off all these boxes; I myself barely qualify, and I&#8217;ve had a few successful companies. Yet by necessity or inspiration many people who aren&#8217;t generally well-suited for entrepreneurship choose it. Some succeed; more fail. But by better understanding ourselves as well as what skills and personality traits go into being successful we can make a more informed decision about whether we should go down that path, and how to proceed if we do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge believer in the power of context and information. It&#8217;s not that I want to tell people what to do; to the contrary, I want people to have the tools to make better decisions. If you can see that 23% of people like you were successful entrepreneurs while 91% of people like you were successful working instead inside a large law firm, you can make a more informed decision. Maybe you still hang out your own shingle, but at least you do so mindful of the gaps between who you are and what that context for success looks like. Rather than sort of arbitrarily flopping around based on limited information and understanding you can benefit from moving toward alignment between your essential self and a life that best fits you.</p>
<p>Seeing my friend be perpetually glum and careen into negative outcomes that are fairly predictable even to the naked eye, hurts. We want ourselves and the people in our lives to be successful, well, and happy. Helping them find alignment between their essential self and the choices they make in their life is a powerful gift.</p>

<figcaption>This woman might be perfect for you, but she would be terrible for me.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every day it becomes more clear to me that the daily ways we judge things as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; are inappropriate. While graduate school taught me the idea†<em>contextual</em>, functionally speaking that needs to extend to†<em>alignment</em>, or how well two or more things actually fit with each other.</p>
<p>I think my wife is terrific. In fact, removing all of the love and emotion I have for her from the equation, I struggle to imagine how someone else would functionally be a better fit for me. Now, I know very well she would not be similarly suited for every man. It just happens that her unique bend of strengths and weaknesses fit with mine in a way that provides a happy and satisfying life. We are incredibly well-aligned. There are other women who might objectively be &#8220;rated&#8221; as more desirable partners by other men. This has no relevance to me. What is important is that I found someone who fits ME. I might, because we&#8217;ve been taught to speak this way, say that &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the best wife!&#8221; But it really isn&#8217;t what I mean, nor would it be true. What I really mean is &#8220;My wife is fantastic, she is really great for ME.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thinking about and eventually re-framing the world this way is freeing. Instead of seeing jobs and people as &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; based on our framing and perception of them, it is just a question of what fits for each of us. Sure, I have personal beliefs that certain ways of behaving &#8211; eating healthier foods, treating people well, avoiding hierarchy and patriarchy in companies &#8211; are objectively better than others. And I want to espouse those things in order to, in my opinion, help people live more full, well and meaningful lives. But allowing this to saturate my worldview, and framing others in positive and negative ways is as destructive as the negative things my personal beliefs are attempting to improve.</p>
<p>For example, I pretty much think Burger King is scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of what people should be eating, for reasons of both taste and health. But, y&#8217;know, for reasons of budget or convenience or taste or just random compulsion, Burger King might be just the right thing for someone else. In that moment, for who they are and what their needs are, it fits. There is alignment between the person and that particular experience.</p>
<p>So where am I going with all of this? After all, Facio is explicitly a service endeavouring to help people achieve better outcomes, and with a particular framing of what better and worse ways of living look like. The secret here is simply shifting from the polarizing, black-and-white language and conceptions we see in partisan politics and the media to a tolerance and even acceptance of the way things and people are. Seeing my friend Baroo walk into our gaming group with a bag of Burger King and thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he is eating that crap&#8221; is counterproductive. Heckling him about it could even be destructive. It does not contribute to moving him toward what I would consider more healthy and positive outcomes. It achieves the opposite by encouraging him to defend his choice publicly and further justify it internally. After all, it represents his choice and for reasons both good and bad literally represents alignment between him and that food from Burger King. In that moment he has made his choice and it fit for him. The best way to try and change that is to make my own choice and, through living it positively and confidently, communicating a different path to him.</p>
<p>People find themselves in a remarkable diversity of moments and situations that, while more often unhealthy or suboptimal in some objective sense, correct and appropriate for who they are at the moment. There is alignment. When there is alignment between ourselves and the people, organizations and things in our life we are happier and more productive. Sure, there is a potential &#8220;better&#8221; out there for us. As John Lennon once wisely said, life is what happens while we&#8217;re busy making other plans. By accepting the present &#8211; even if and as we strive for a better future &#8211; and embracing and accepting alignment in the moment we will most certainly better from it. It is not about being best or correct; it is about what fits and works. Live on!</p>
