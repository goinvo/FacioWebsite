				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Genuine tragedies in the world are not conflicts between right and wrong. They are conflicts between two rights.&#8221;  - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</em></p>
<p>Hegel was talking about wars, but the insight is relevant to everyday life. What makes dealing well with other people so difficult is that each of our perspectives and motives are &#8220;right&#8221; subjectively, &#8220;right&#8221; at least in some part small or large objectively, and the degree to which they cause trouble is in their coming into conflict with the perspectives and motives of others. I was keenly reminded of this while catching up with an old employee recently.</p>
<p>They (call him Richie) were telling me about how their most recent employment ended. From their perspective, the person responsible for managing the software project they were on the team for (call him Zane) was making poor decisions, and those decisions led to repeated failure in the eyes of the business unit. Richie decided to go over Zane&#8217;s head to his boss and explain the failures were due to Zane&#8217;s poor management. Zane&#8217;s boss, who perhaps had a closer relationship with Zane than Richie realized, told Zane about the complaint and Zane quickly fired Richie. After being fired, Richie went one level higher up in the organization about the issue, which led to a larger internal inquiry that sucked in everyone on the team. Result? Richie, who had already been fired, stayed fired. However, his co-workers validated his complaints and Zane was removed from management and demoted.</p>
<p>I only have one person&#8217;s rendition of this story, so let&#8217;s treat it is a hypothetical. Who is right and who is wrong? Consider:</p>
<p>1. Zane manages the project/team in a particular way</p>
<p>2. The project has a series of misfires and draws negative attention from the rest of the organization</p>
<p>3. Richie perceives Zane as the problem and wants to change the situation</p>
<p>4. Richie goes over Zane&#8217;s head to have the situation addressed</p>
<p>5. Zane feels blindsided to discover that Richie is trying to undermine him</p>
<p>6. Zane sees Richie as insubordinate and fires him</p>
<p>7. Richie accelerates his campaign to have Zane addressed</p>
<p>8. Zane is demoted</p>
<p>This is a typical sort of &#8220;everyday tragedy&#8221; that happens in business. Zane is managing poorly. Richie responds to that badly, neither addressing it with Zane directly or raising incremental issues instead of going nuclear. Each certainly had reasons that seemed correct to them, Zane for his managerial choices and Richie for how he attempted to work up the chain to address them. Both felt correct and justified. And yet, each also presumably felt the other was entirely unreasonable and derelict in their duty. Either or both of them may have been correct. It is a knotted mess, and the very essence of Hegel&#8217;s conception of tragedy.</p>
<p>As with most things, simple communication would likely have mitigated this entire escalation: if Richie or others had tried to address the situation more incrementally, before it become so problematic. If Richie had tried to speak with Zane first, instead of going to his boss to begin with. If Zane had seemed more open to constructive feedback, cultivating an environment of openness and growth. If Zane had used the experience as a moment of growth instead of a club to hit Richie with. Yet, the lack of these things resulted in the project experiencing repeated failures, Richie out of a job, and Zane demoted.</p>
<p>This sort of situation is all too common in business, but ultimately easy to address within the right culture. While conflicts between right and right are inevitable, there is no reason for them to devolve into tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies that talk the whole transparency talk almost always draw the line on the historically most sensitive of topics: compensation. There is a notion that compensation is too sensitive, that letting everyone know what each other makes is just going to invite problems that you really don&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>There is some merit to this line of thinking. After all, the way we compensate people is hardly a meritocracy. The nature of business requires us to get most employees at as low a rate of compensation as we possibly can, in order to keep the business healthy. In the process, it is inevitable that some people are overpaid relative to their worth, while others are underpaid. This makes employees having transparency into compensation potentially frightening. More, given the relationship some people have between their relative pay and essential self-worth, the risk can go beyond destabilizing your organization to include impacting the self-esteem of one or more of your employees. It all sounds pretty scary, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a flip side to salary transparency. For one, it promotes accountability. If your organization is generally healthy, employees won&#8217;t let others skate by, and doubly so if they are overpaid relative to their contributions. The openness of information can help you get more out of underperformers in general, but particularly those who are overpaid. Now, it will also encourage top performers who are underpaid to possibly ask for more money. But ultimately, that&#8217;s OK. Paying good people what they are worth should never be a problem; the problem is overpaying people who aren&#8217;t worth it. Another benefit can be that it helps to hasten the departure of poor performers, but if you are managing well you shouldn&#8217;t need salary transparency to accomplish <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>The big picture upside to salary transparency is that it can, indeed, lead to a meritocratic workplace. This may not seem like a great idea to employers, who know that they get great deals on some of their employees, for whom their relative underpayment remains blissful ignorance. But that is the wrong way to look at it. The best companies are populated by motivated high performers. Knowing they are paid fairly is one of the characteristics of high performers. And for those poorly paid poor performers, well, they either need to be performing better or moving along. The net is transformative, as top performers thrive in an open environment and under performers are helped to change themselves or move into a situation where which they better align. It will surely be better for your business, and chances are it will ultimately be better for your people as well.</p>

<figcaption>Transparency, real and contrived</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Fox television network in the United States recently began airing a reality television program called <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em> The premise of the show is that &#8220;brave&#8221; owners of a small company temporarily turn the management of the company over to their employees, in order for their staff to be &#8220;empowered&#8221; and make decisions to help improve the organization. There are many problems with this premise: the focus is not on real development but spectacles like all the employees seeing video ripping one another; sharing the salaries for all of the employees not for transparency but as blood-in-the-water salaciousness; the poor leadership inherent in a company that would play this contrived process out on television; the fact it is contorted to the reality show standard of &#8220;identify a small group to potentially &#8216;vote off the island&#8217;.&#8221; And, the transparency they claim to be fostering is nonsense, as the owners don&#8217;t show what they are making, just the staff that the show wants to rip each other apart. There is some sociological benefit from watching the show, but it is purely as spectacle, a look at negative traits like jealousy, insecurity, deflection and covering one&#8217;s ass.</p>
<p>Real transparency, for the right reasons, is done carefully and in the spirit of building. Watch <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em> and think about these contrasting points:</p>
<p>1. You would never record the employees under a false premise and then ambush them by showing their out-of-context clips saying negatives things about other people. Getting people to be honest and talking about issues or areas of growth needs to be done in a safe, nurturing, productive way. It is hard and takes time to evolve a culture into this mode, and rather than the impact bringing out the worst in employees it typically brings out the best.</p>
<p>2. Making change starts at the top. Healthy change incorporates bottom-up input and participation, to benefit from insights at every level of a company. But that is not achieved by throwing the situation into the laps of employees and running and hiding. It requires the ownership and leadership to lead by example, having the hard conversations and taking responsibility for the difficult things.</p>
<p>3. Planning and communication is the heart of productive transparency. Just slinging information at employees without proper framing and context can foster misunderstanding and small-minded, counter-productive behaviour. It takes time to really plan what you are doing and why, then crafting consistent and even seemingly over-communication to ensure that &#8220;transparency&#8221; has some structure and productive meaning, not just a dump of information whose relevance is obfuscated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I was excited about the idea of <em>Does Someone Have To Go?</em>. Optimistically &#8211; or, better, foolishly &#8211; I thought we might have a program that provides a deep and insightful look into change management. Instead we have a program that confirms the very worst people think about reality programs that serves as a model to illustrate the wrong way to include and empower your people.</p>

<figcaption>Context and development</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I read an article talking about how professional basketballer players in the National Basketball League tend to develop relative to the context that they are placed in. Good, young players who are drafted by or traded to top teams that are already successful, having coaching stability, and have clearly established roles and performers in place are more likely to reach their potential. Former coach Jeff Van Gundy credits this sort of development to the player &#8220;know(ing) who he is, and play(ing) to his role.&#8221; This theory goes on to suggest that while talented young players blossom in these conditions, the same players become mediocre when playing for poor teams because, with too much expected of them as &#8220;saviors&#8221; of a bleak situation, they struggle to figure out who they are, and they don&#8217;t have a clear, realistic role.</p>
<p>Thee dynamics are particularly pronounced in professional basketball, where a franchise has just 12 players working for them, making a combined ~$58,000,000 &#8211; or almost $5,000,000 each on average. On the other hand IBM reports having 434,246 employees nationwide, meaning that no matter how stringent and ideal their top-down structures might be the provision of ideal employee environments will often be determined at at the level of a sub-organization or even an individual team. In business we do not enjoy the intense focus on a handful of people that allows the best organizations to consistently develop better performers.</p>
<p>The lesson is that doing things the right way does not just help you perform better in the short-term, it creates an environment of excellence that helps you perform better later. New employees are far more likely to find their place and carve out a specific role suitable to their abilities in a stable and high-functioning organization. Yes, as always, this won&#8217;t prove true for everyone. Superstars often benefit from being &#8220;dropped into the deep end&#8221; and being given more room and freedom to develop as opposed to being constrained by a system. Remember: the Chicago Bulls were abysmal before Michael Jordan came to town, not winning more than 45 games in any season from 1975-1984. He thrived by stepping into the mess. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, while mediocre performers might become better versions of themselves in healthy organizations, they also aren&#8217;t likely to be transformed into high performers just by virtue of the context. The limitations that make them less capable &#8211; lacking in skills, motivation or just generally not embracing and putting themselves into their careers &#8211; are more difficult to change.</p>
<p>Regardless, the bottom line is that the best way to get the most out of the majority of new hires you will make is having already implemented the bedrock of a high-performing culture: stability that crosses all of vision and strategy, management and team composition, with appropriate roles and processes that work well and are adaptable to make the most of the unique gifts and offerings of the specific people.</p>

<p>High-achieving employees who combine a strong work ethic and good attention to detail tend to be hands-on managers. Typical, positive traits of good hands-on managers is their &#8220;showing&#8221; excellence in action to their employees, keeping their eye on assignments and development plans, and pushing them to success. One of the down sides of this management style &#8211; that sometimes seems like a strength &#8211; is intervening to ensure their employees don&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p>Yes, preventing a failure of some sort in the moment is good for the system and assignment &#8211; in the moment. The challenge is, people need to be trusted and empowered to see something through to completion. Whether they succeed or fail, the process of going to the end and the learnings that they take from that are invaluable. Sure, they are also learning when watching someone more seasoned do it for them. But the real learning requires both watching and doing. In the early going, the doing is going to be wrong.</p>
<p>I know, I know: for people who pursue and achieve excellence it can be hard to watch that failing happen. But it is just part of the process. In the days of master craftsmen, it was understood that there would be some waste: of time, of materials. It was literally built into the expectations of the relationship with that apprentice. Just watching, no matter for how long, doesn&#8217;t get you all the way there. Those lessons so ingrained into generations of craftspeople have been lost as we all naturally careen through the workplace.</p>
<p>The reality is, failing is important. For young professionals, for children, for all of us who are doing new things &#8211; part of evolving beyond ignorance and clumsiness is feeling what it is like to fall down. When we see others who are struggling to figure something out, it might be hard not to help. And certainly, sometimes helping is good and important. But sometimes, every now and then, we also need to let them fail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The older I get, the more deeply I value the role of specialist coaches and consultants to get the most out of our people and organization.</p>
<p>At first, investing in a coach or consultant can seem expensive. Comparing their hourly rate to what you could hire someone for, or going down the logic trail of &#8220;I pay Bob big bucks already, if I need to pay these rates to a coach to get Bob on track then why is Bob here in the first place?&#8221; is a self-destructive exercise. Consider:</p>
<p>First, each of us have strengths and weaknesses. So it is likely that many of us are in roles where our strengths are not being optimized and our weaknesses further exposed. Or, if we are, our weaknesses are going to spring up from time-to-time. The expectation that we should just be plug-and-play effective is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Next, none of us are perfect. We have good days and bad; even good and bad weeks or months. While the &#8220;bad&#8221; periods are certainly not good for anyone &#8211; including our employer who presumably keeps paying us regardless &#8211; they should be expected. &#8220;Bob&#8221; in my above example may be struggling, but our simply expecting him to suck it up and improve since we&#8217;re paying him isn&#8217;t consistent with reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, improving and actually contributing more than we are otherwise able takes an investment. This might be an investment of time or money, but either way something different needs to happen to be a catalyst for, well, different things starting to happen! Expecting it to happen through osmosis or because someone is given a pep talk (or development plan) is scattershot and puts the success or failure outside of your hands as a manager or employer.</p>
<p>The great thing about a strong coach is that they bring the total package to the table: it is their time that goes into managing the development; it is their specialized expertise that makes the most of the development; it is their experience doing this with many other people that makes it likely the development is going to succeed.</p>

<figcaption>When we hear the word &#8220;coach&#8221; it might conjure up images of someone with a whistle, but professional coaches can transform your employees and business.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember an employee who once worked for me. An extremely hard-working fellow, very nice and generally capable, he just didn&#8217;t seem able to &#8220;make it happen&#8221; in the things we were expecting of him. And, we didn&#8217;t really know how to properly guide or necessarily manage him. Despite the fact he was jut the kind of person we wanted in our organization, we were frustrated with him. We talked about letting him go. We couldn&#8217;t understand why he didn&#8217;t just &#8220;make it happen.&#8221; Instead of letting our frustration take us to the point of letting him go, we doubled down and provided him with a coach. He immediately began to excel. The coach&#8217;s combination of management attention and domain-specific guidance and expertise was transformative. Not only did his performance significantly improve, the coach told us he&#8217;s one of the strongest employees he&#8217;s ever worked with, an absolute model.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#8217;t made the investment in the coach, it would have ended very differently. And, we paid less for the coach than paying a recruiter to replace our employee &#8211; with someone who likely would not have been the same kind of star &#8211; would have cost. Literally everyone won as the company&#8217;s bottom line benefitted, our culture was burgeoned from re-investing in someone everyone liked, and the employee&#8217;s potential was fully unlocked in way that were not just beneficial to success in his role but also to him personally.</p>
<p>This is just one example, but it really illustrates the power a good coach can have. Yes, the hourly rate might seem high. Yes, our intuition might be that the employee should just &#8220;suck it up&#8221; and &#8220;get the job done&#8221;. These are just bad excuses. The investment in a good coach or consultant is an investment of vision. It is one of those uncommon things that is likely to have a positive impact on both your short-term bottom line and your long-term culture and employee wellness. If you have an employee who is generally a good fit, double-down on unlocking their potential.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to turn 40 this year. Beyond symbolically being &#8220;in the middle&#8221;, it puts me square in the middle of two very different ways of looking at the work world.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="People Leave" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PeopleLeave.jpg" alt="People Leave" /><br />
<figcaption>Trying to prevent people from leaving, or punishing them for doing so, is a sign of poor management.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I grew up being taught that you should find a good company, give them your best effort for 40&#8242;ish years, be well rewarded, then retire and live The Good Life of laying around and taking up a hobby. The reality of today&#8217;s workplace is that people search for opportunities that provide the right experience and/or lifestyle, then are quick to seek out and move into positions elsewhere that are better fits for the life they want to live. It took me a couple of jobs to shift from seeing work as &#8220;married forever&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s mostly about me&#8221;. The changes are a good thing, but some of our thinking remains mired in the older, outmoded ways.</p>
<p>Recently one of my employees left Facio. He was an outstanding contributor and very strong cultural fit. However, another company more mature than us recognized his excellence and offered him 50% more salary and going from overseeing a team of two others to overseeing a team of 30 others. It greatly accelerated his career arc, and more rapidly put him in a position that aligned with the breadth of impact he wants to have. While terribly disappointed to lose him, I was thrilled for the chance he was being given.</p>
<p>Often times we do not have that open-minded reaction. More than once, I&#8217;ve seen reactions to an announced departure range from anger to betrayal to disgust. Not only does it not honour the person who is leaving, it is entirely counter-productive. Other employees seeing an adverse reaction to a departure are learning how the employer treats other employees, and take for granted they may be subjected to the same negativity. It lowers morale, decreases loyalty and can have a chilling impact on the environment. Treating people positively and supportively is better for your company, better for them, and ultimately better for you. Positive emotions are proven to increase the quality and length of our lives.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: people leave. Sometimes you want them to; other times you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you are surprised; other times you see it coming. Sometimes they are leaving at a clean and comfortable moment; other times it is exceedingly messy and inconvenient. Regardless of the particular circumstances, expecting that people are (all!) going to leave should be a given, and making their departure as positive it can be given the specific circumstances is the best thing you can do in your role for your employer and for yourself as a citizen.</p>

<figcaption>A little bit of training and discipline when a new employee starts can go a long way to making their tenure with you a success.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not enough attention or investment is paid to training new employees. Well-orchestrated and properly designed training is proven to increase retention. More than that, it creates alignment between the new hire and the expectations of the company, management and their particular position. It also is the best time to get an employee&#8217;s behaviour to shift from their past or natural inclinations into what your organization needs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the phrase &#8220;honeymoon phase&#8221;. This is the period when a person &#8211; whether in a new job or new relationship &#8211; is behaving aspirationally and trying to adapt to better fit with their opposite. Not only is it the time when you see more of the &#8220;best self&#8221; of a person, it is when they are most susceptible to training and change.</p>
<p>You have a short period of time after a new employee comes to teach them new things that require big behavior change and make it stick. Even if someone doesn&#8217;t like process &#8211; say, using Salesforce.com to track their sales activity &#8211; you can often get them on board and using it if you get them on it early and turn it into a habit. On the other hand, when you have an employee who has been working at your company without that discipline for a long time and then you try to get them on it, it is much harder.</p>
<p>Being sure to train new employees just makes sense. We invest our time and money in finding and closing new talent; shouldn&#8217;t we do our best to make their tenure as long and productive as possible? It&#8217;s a no brainer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of us have unique motivations, and it can be difficult to figure out what each of our needs might be.</p>
<p>I have two primary professional motivations. The healthier of these is to see people I care about happy and fulfilled, thanks in some significant part to things I&#8217;ve done. My pursuit is easy for others to see: as an entrepreneur, I set up my companies and workspaces in extremely employee-friendly ways. From our use of space to our policies and procedures to the way I engage with people one-on-one, it is obvious observing these entities that the people in charge are deeply committed to the holistic wellness and satisfaction of everyone there.</p>
<p>Despite having an objective awareness of succeeding with this, hearing from people that they appreciate this has a significant impact. This week I had a call with a woman who was my assistant some years ago. She was excellent for us, and I genuinely like her. During the call, she mentioned that she often tells people about me, and how I was a great boss. Hearing this meant a lot! While I am generally uncomfortable with praise &#8211; particularly in public or in groups &#8211; and don&#8217;t need the positive reinforcement very often, this not only made my day, it made my week. Even though I <em>already know </em>without outside validation that I mostly succeed in making my employees feel valued and special, that little bit of heartfelt appreciation validated me and was a micro-celebration of what I set out to achieve.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Motivate and Validate" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/InvoCbus_studio-e1362464934459.jpg" alt="Motivate and Validate" /><br />
<figcaption>Our studio space is striking, but it was designed not for aesthetic reasons but its impact on our people.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each of us has needs such as these. The trick is, we don&#8217;t typically talk about what they are, and figuring them out can be pretty complicated. Taking my example, someone could easily misinterpret the things I do with my companies and think, for example, that what validates me is creating pretty spaces. Or getting the most out of my employees. Or some other things that &#8211; if they gave me a compliment about it &#8211; would be a nice little warm fuzzy.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t rub that special place. For me it is not about the business benefit, or the trappings, it is about the human impact. That&#8217;s not something I talk about &#8211; although I surely do write about it! &#8211; and for a theoretical boss or co-worker to understand that motivation, put me in a position to pursue it, and give me an appropriate level of recognition for it is not likely. Similar to most people, my deepest inner drivers are somewhat opaque. Indeed, for me it is complicated by my extreme introversion. Since I am so overt about that introversion &#8211; which can make it &#8220;seem&#8221; like I don&#8217;t necessarily like or care about other people &#8211; it further obfuscates that motivation, which really means so much to me.</p>
<p>What are your motivations? Do others really understand them? Do they validate you in the ways you need? What about the people you work with: do you really know what drives them?</p>
<p>As much as culture, productivity and other buzzwords, this is important.</p>

<figcaption>Being brave and thoughtful when letting people go includes encouraging them to engage you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember the first job I had where I had responsibility for hiring and firing. I was young and inexperienced, promoted beyond the point I was properly trained for. What I quickly found was that letting go younger or more junior people was easy, but letting go older and very senior people was difficult. I distinctly remember one person in particular: letting him go was a decision made by three of us at the executive level, and I chose to not participate in telling him, then more-or-less hiding while he packed up his things and left. It is among the most cowardly things I’ve ever done.</p>
<p>Letting people go is difficult. There is no getting around that. However, particularly as the person who made or contributed to the decision, you owe it to the person to have the courage to engage them and stretch yourself in the process. After all, no matter how much they may have deserved to be let go, no matter how much they may have made your life more difficult, from a power dynamics perspective you are the “winner”. You remain in the soft embrace of your employer, with paychecks continuing to roll in. They are being cast out into an uncertain and likely scary unknown that could have major repercussions on people who rely on them, too. It is thus incumbent upon you to stretch yourself in that termination process.</p>
<p>Now, with more experience and wisdom, I always engage deeply into the process of letting someone go. If it is appropriate, I want to be in the meeting where they are let go. At the very least, I am going to engage them that same day and give them an opportunity to ask me questions, or vent, or just talk about it. They are going to know they have an open door to talk during the “dead man walking” period, or anytime after. And, on their last day, I’m going to shake their hand and thank them for something they did for us that was good. It models how I want other employees to act, how I want our organization to behave, and treats the soon-departing in the best possible way.</p>
<p>They say the final cut is the cruelest. Surely, it does not need to be. By taking responsibility, being brave and treating people with consideration and respect it can be the honorable end to one thing and, hopefully, lead to something better for both sides.</p>
