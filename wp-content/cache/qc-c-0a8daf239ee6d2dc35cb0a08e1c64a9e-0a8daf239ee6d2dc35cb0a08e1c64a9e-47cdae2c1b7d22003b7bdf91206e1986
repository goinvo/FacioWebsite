<figcaption>Context and development</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I read an article talking about how professional basketballer players in the National Basketball League tend to develop relative to the context that they are placed in. Good, young players who are drafted by or traded to top teams that are already successful, having coaching stability, and have clearly established roles and performers in place are more likely to reach their potential. Former coach Jeff Van Gundy credits this sort of development to the player &#8220;know(ing) who he is, and play(ing) to his role.&#8221; This theory goes on to suggest that while talented young players blossom in these conditions, the same players become mediocre when playing for poor teams because, with too much expected of them as &#8220;saviors&#8221; of a bleak situation, they struggle to figure out who they are, and they don&#8217;t have a clear, realistic role.</p>
<p>Thee dynamics are particularly pronounced in professional basketball, where a franchise has just 12 players working for them, making a combined ~$58,000,000 &#8211; or almost $5,000,000 each on average. On the other hand IBM reports having 434,246 employees nationwide, meaning that no matter how stringent and ideal their top-down structures might be the provision of ideal employee environments will often be determined at at the level of a sub-organization or even an individual team. In business we do not enjoy the intense focus on a handful of people that allows the best organizations to consistently develop better performers.</p>
<p>The lesson is that doing things the right way does not just help you perform better in the short-term, it creates an environment of excellence that helps you perform better later. New employees are far more likely to find their place and carve out a specific role suitable to their abilities in a stable and high-functioning organization. Yes, as always, this won&#8217;t prove true for everyone. Superstars often benefit from being &#8220;dropped into the deep end&#8221; and being given more room and freedom to develop as opposed to being constrained by a system. Remember: the Chicago Bulls were abysmal before Michael Jordan came to town, not winning more than 45 games in any season from 1975-1984. He thrived by stepping into the mess. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, while mediocre performers might become better versions of themselves in healthy organizations, they also aren&#8217;t likely to be transformed into high performers just by virtue of the context. The limitations that make them less capable &#8211; lacking in skills, motivation or just generally not embracing and putting themselves into their careers &#8211; are more difficult to change.</p>
<p>Regardless, the bottom line is that the best way to get the most out of the majority of new hires you will make is having already implemented the bedrock of a high-performing culture: stability that crosses all of vision and strategy, management and team composition, with appropriate roles and processes that work well and are adaptable to make the most of the unique gifts and offerings of the specific people.</p>

			<p>It is common for small businesses to say &#8220;We&#8217;re really more like a family.&#8221; While well intentioned, the analogy is not particularly flattering. Even relatively happy families have complicated interpersonal conflict, are emotionally charged, and get caught up in the needs of the individuals over the good of the group. To the contrary, high-performing businesses require low friction relationships, objectivity without being excessively personal, and a focus on shared goals instead of individual gratification. Sure, being friendly and caring about each other is an important aspect of high-functioning teams and strong cultures. Certainly not at a level that resembles that of a family, however. In fact, it is not uncommon for small companies to express the dysfunctions often on display in families, because their small size and static power relationships lend themselves to developing similar characteristics. The analogy has merit, it just isn&#8217;t the personality companies should be going for.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been told to &#8220;keep it professional,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing personal,&#8221; or some other platitude related to maintaining objectivity and viewing our professionals behaviours as being distinctly removed from our personal selves. I remember a line in a movie where the actor said something like, &#8220;When someone tells you it&#8217;s not personal, that&#8217;s when you know it is very personal.&#8221; While a catchy line, it&#8217;s not particularly true. Yes, for the person being adversely impacted by whatever is happening, if they do not maintain an appropriate professional detachment, the disappointment or upset becomes a personal feeling. That is an error of framing by that individual. In fact, we need to be diligent to remember that it isn&#8217;t, or at least shouldn&#8217;t be, personal. Great businesses come from straddling the right side of that delicate line.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s easy. I remember more than one time when something that was happening in my professional life felt personal, I treated as personal, and in some cases reacted in inappropriate emotional ways. It took time and experience to adjust my expectations and reactions. More than part of my professional development, it was an aspect of my personal development. Thinking back on my career, I can&#8217;t think of any moment when my own or a colleague&#8217;s bring the personal into a distinctly professional situation was for the better.</p>
<p>So make friends at work. Be yourself as much as is appropriate in the specific professional context you inhabit. Imbue your participation with that goodness. In addition, keep it professional. Remember that your employer is ultimately in business to make good business decisions, not necessarily give you the raise or promotion or ongoing employment you want or think you deserve. Your boss might need to let you go. She might still be your friend; it&#8217;s nothing personal. The challenge for you is to manage to keep it professional.</p>

			<p>Personality (n.) - The combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual&#8217;s distinctive character.</p>
<p>It seems pretty simple. But dictionary definitions aside, our notions of personality are either incomplete, or dictated by the conceptual models provided by different people or organizations. Incomplete, because we equate characteristic such as extraversion as being personality. They may be a part of it, but they surely are not all of it. That is easy enough to understand.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="The Binds of Personality Typing" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The-Binds-of-Personality-Typing.png" alt="The Binds of Personality Typing" /><br />
<figcaption>The Binds of Personality Typing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The relationship between personality and conceptual models is a fair bit more difficult to untangle. These models &#8211; things like the four-letter personality type designed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers and the DISC method of William Marston &#8211; are helpful aids in providing us with understanding. One of the wonderful benefits of these tools is providing structure that lead to understanding. I warmly remember being first exposed to such methods in my mid-20&#8242;s via the work of David Keirsey. Whereas, up to that point, much of my understanding of others was that they were &#8220;nice&#8221; or &#8220;aggressive&#8221; or &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;quiet&#8221;, suddenly I had a more sophisticated vocabulary. More than that, I had a framework within which I fit, where I could &#8220;see&#8221; myself and &#8211; in resonating with the things that I read &#8211; feel empowered. As time went on and I learned more it also helped me to understand others.</p>
<p>These are lovely things, all. But there are problems. None of these frameworks agree with each other. There is truth to be gleaned from each of them, but which is &#8220;right&#8221;? If one is ultimately correct in any discernable way we will likely have a hard time figuring out which one, as the creators or licensees of each advocate their own to further personal gain. Unfortunately, research universities largely stay away from applied personality frameworks which is indeed a shame, as some greater level of objectivity and rigour may be offered by those organizations.</p>
<p>Yet, discerning truth is the least of it. A larger issue is the closing down of how we look at and interpret the world. As empowering as these frameworks initially are, and as helpful as they can prove to be, they also lock our thinking into them. We see the world as ENTP&#8217;s, or as DC&#8217;s, or as 2-2-1-1&#8242;s. Practitioners as well as normal individuals associate themselves with one method or another and use that as their lens to understand personality. While each of those conceptions are interesting and useful, they are also limiting. None offers a complete picture, and they teach us to translate our understanding of others into their idiosyncratic form. It is not a completely bad thing, there are many good things about the tools. But they naturally keep us from thinking beyond their bounds both because of the benefits they provide, and the bounds themselves.</p>
<p>So by all means, learn about personality models. Learn from the smart work that has been done, discover yourself, develop tools to understand others. But don&#8217;t let that be the only language you speak in and think about this vitally important thing, personality. Stay open-minded. Learn about other methods. Nuance both your understanding and interpretation. It is the next step to greater enlightenment in the complicated world of human understanding.</p>

<figcaption>Let them fail</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>High-achieving employees who combine a strong work ethic and good attention to detail tend to be hands-on managers. Typical, positive traits of good hands-on managers is their &#8220;showing&#8221; excellence in action to their employees, keeping their eye on assignments and development plans, and pushing them to success. One of the down sides of this management style &#8211; that sometimes seems like a strength &#8211; is intervening to ensure their employees don&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p>Yes, preventing a failure of some sort in the moment is good for the system and assignment &#8211; in the moment. The challenge is, people need to be trusted and empowered to see something through to completion. Whether they succeed or fail, the process of going to the end and the learnings that they take from that are invaluable. Sure, they are also learning when watching someone more seasoned do it for them. But the real learning requires both watching and doing. In the early going, the doing is going to be wrong.</p>
<p>I know, I know: for people who pursue and achieve excellence it can be hard to watch that failing happen. But it is just part of the process. In the days of master craftsmen, it was understood that there would be some waste: of time, of materials. It was literally built into the expectations of the relationship with that apprentice. Just watching, no matter for how long, doesn&#8217;t get you all the way there. Those lessons so ingrained into generations of craftspeople have been lost as we all naturally careen through the workplace.</p>
<p>The reality is, failing is important. For young professionals, for children, for all of us who are doing new things &#8211; part of evolving beyond ignorance and clumsiness is feeling what it is like to fall down. When we see others who are struggling to figure something out, it might be hard not to help. And certainly, sometimes helping is good and important. But sometimes, every now and then, we also need to let them fail.</p>

			<p>My friend Bo used to encourage me to give grace, to myself and to others. It is great advice that I was reminded of when <a href="http://www.thestar.com/life/2013/04/17/dove_video_ad_shows_women_are_more_beautiful_than_they_think.html" target="_blank">watching this video</a>.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Giving grace" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Grace.png" alt="Giving grace" /></p>
<figcaption>We are terribly hard on ourselves. We needn&#8217;t be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Leaving my skepticism on the shelf &#8211; the creator of the video, Dove, is part of an industry that fosters the same insecurities they are raising awareness of &#8211; the video illustrates how hard we are on ourselves. Rather than giving ourselves grace &#8211; focusing on the things we like, de-emphasizing or at least proportionally acknowledging the things we don&#8217;t &#8211; most of us in the western first world are hard on ourselves. It&#8217;s one of the byproducts of the values underlying success in the free market. We have learned to obsess and feel shame about our failings while overlooking all of the lovely things that each and every one of us have to offer.</p>
<p>There is very little to gain by flogging ourselves for being something other than who we are. While behaviours unhealthy to ourselves and others should be acknowledged and mitigated, otherwise we are best-served by just accepting who we are and leveraging our positives. It will provide us with uniformly improved happiness and well-being, while positioning us in a more confident and positive light with those we love, live and work with. At the core, it is about giving ourselves grace.</p>
<p>But we, ourselves, are only part of the equation. One of the mistakes I still frequently make is being disappointed in people who don&#8217;t do things how I would do them. Let me give you an example. On Twitter, when people converse with me, 99% of the time I&#8217;m going to respond and acknowledge them. I don&#8217;t care if I follow them or not, don&#8217;t care who or what they are. If they take the time to genuinely engage me in some way I want to show them the respect and appreciation of acknowledgement. Well, recently I sent a message to someone I don&#8217;t know, complimenting them and trying in a very small way to engage. Days passed; they did not respond. It materially changed the way I felt toward them. I was even embarrassed to not be responded to and deleted my original tweet!</p>
<p>What a shame. I have no way of knowing why that person didn&#8217;t respond to me. The odds that it was for some reason that I would actually find hurtful &#8211; they think I&#8217;m not worthy of the time &#8211; are quite low. There are dozens of other, very benign, reasons they didn&#8217;t acknowledge me. Yet, I put my own framing on the situation and chose to have negative feelings: about them, about the situation, and about myself. Isn&#8217;t it ridiculous? Why do we assume the worst? Why do we not give others the grace to be themselves?</p>
<p>As I get older, I am less apt to shenanigans such as that example. But it is hard to just naturally and easily give others grace. It is not how we are generally taught, and we are making ourselves vulnerable by leaning into that possible weakness or embarrassment. In most cases, though, that vulnerability is unlikely to turn into something actually hurtful. Instead, by foregoing our fear, we have less negative energy, more self-assuredness, and are treating ourselves and others better. It&#8217;s a no brainer, really, but often easier said than done. When in doubt, give yourself (or them) grace!</p>
