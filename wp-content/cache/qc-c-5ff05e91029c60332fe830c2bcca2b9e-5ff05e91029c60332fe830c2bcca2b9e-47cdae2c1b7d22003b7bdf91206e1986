				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The differences between &#8220;morning people&#8221; and &#8220;night people&#8221; are significant, as is the way they intersect with one another and their employer.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Morning and Night" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Morning-Night_300.jpg" alt="Morning Night" /></p>
<figcaption>The time of day you are at your best may suggest more about you than you realize.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Morning people tend to be more optimistic, physically energetic and proactive. Night people tend to be more intelligent, creative and have a better sense of humour. As always, these generalities are not true for all members of the group. While each of these types have clear advantages, the biggest impact of any of these things is the fact that morning people&#8217;s natural rhythms are aligned with the 9-5 professional world, while night people&#8217;s are not. Research has shown that, as a direct result of these issues of chronotype, morning people do better in school, have access to better institutes of higher learning, get better jobs, and enjoy more lucrative career arcs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty massive impact on our life outcomes! Now, step back and consider it from a societal perspective: if night people are generally more intelligent, but morning people are getting the better access to superior learning and work opportunities, we are by definition using our available resources inefficiently. Thanks to what is essentially thousands of years of inertia around structuring our societies around the daylight &#8211; after all, the electric light is less than 150 years old as an established technology &#8211; our societal systems support and reward morning people while punishing night people. We have not shifted the rhythm of systems and organizations to match how people live, instead naturally preserving the way it has always been done.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions. Not surprisingly, they are exceptions created by the marketplace. Once it became possible to have factory workers work day and night, shifts were added so the workers would go day and night. This was done because the benefits were obvious, and quantifiable: enabling people to produce at all hours of the day increases profits for the employer. These industries at this point have reached an even more sophisticated level of maturity, no longer just going flat-out at all times but crafting schedules that reflect when their people are most productive. All of this is easy, because the benefits are transparent.</p>
<p>While it is clumsy to claim that having the smarter people get the better opportunities would lead to better organizational success and profits &#8211; who knows, perhaps optimism is more important than intelligence? &#8211; it is immediately clear that having the preponderance of societal organizations catering to morning people at the expense of night people is illogical. Technology has rendered such coarse methods obsolete. If our systems didn&#8217;t try to jam night people into the rhythms of the morning people, what potential would that unlock? How would it improve their lives? How would they contribute more and better? Even though these are not easily quantifiable, our society and its citizens would clearly benefit from more flexible systems that work for both the people of the morning, and the people of the night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of us have unique motivations, and it can be difficult to figure out what each of our needs might be.</p>
<p>I have two primary professional motivations. The healthier of these is to see people I care about happy and fulfilled, thanks in some significant part to things I&#8217;ve done. My pursuit is easy for others to see: as an entrepreneur, I set up my companies and workspaces in extremely employee-friendly ways. From our use of space to our policies and procedures to the way I engage with people one-on-one, it is obvious observing these entities that the people in charge are deeply committed to the holistic wellness and satisfaction of everyone there.</p>
<p>Despite having an objective awareness of succeeding with this, hearing from people that they appreciate this has a significant impact. This week I had a call with a woman who was my assistant some years ago. She was excellent for us, and I genuinely like her. During the call, she mentioned that she often tells people about me, and how I was a great boss. Hearing this meant a lot! While I am generally uncomfortable with praise &#8211; particularly in public or in groups &#8211; and don&#8217;t need the positive reinforcement very often, this not only made my day, it made my week. Even though I <em>already know </em>without outside validation that I mostly succeed in making my employees feel valued and special, that little bit of heartfelt appreciation validated me and was a micro-celebration of what I set out to achieve.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Motivate and Validate" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/InvoCbus_studio-e1362464934459.jpg" alt="Motivate and Validate" /><br />
<figcaption>Our studio space is striking, but it was designed not for aesthetic reasons but its impact on our people.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each of us has needs such as these. The trick is, we don&#8217;t typically talk about what they are, and figuring them out can be pretty complicated. Taking my example, someone could easily misinterpret the things I do with my companies and think, for example, that what validates me is creating pretty spaces. Or getting the most out of my employees. Or some other things that &#8211; if they gave me a compliment about it &#8211; would be a nice little warm fuzzy.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t rub that special place. For me it is not about the business benefit, or the trappings, it is about the human impact. That&#8217;s not something I talk about &#8211; although I surely do write about it! &#8211; and for a theoretical boss or co-worker to understand that motivation, put me in a position to pursue it, and give me an appropriate level of recognition for it is not likely. Similar to most people, my deepest inner drivers are somewhat opaque. Indeed, for me it is complicated by my extreme introversion. Since I am so overt about that introversion &#8211; which can make it &#8220;seem&#8221; like I don&#8217;t necessarily like or care about other people &#8211; it further obfuscates that motivation, which really means so much to me.</p>
<p>What are your motivations? Do others really understand them? Do they validate you in the ways you need? What about the people you work with: do you really know what drives them?</p>
<p>As much as culture, productivity and other buzzwords, this is important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two things we&#8217;ve talked about so far &#8211; teaching self-understanding from a young age, and channeling students earlier into more specific courses of study &#8211; require significant changes to the existing school systems, to say nothing of the shift away from math and science as the must-have, end-all-be-all courses of study for all university-bound students. What we are going to talk about today &#8211; giving service and exploring the world &#8211; would benefit from broad adoption but is a choice any young person can make today. And, most of them should.</p>
<p>Some of us have a good idea the path we want to take when we get out of high school. Most of us don&#8217;t. More than just changing majors, many of us change schools. We don&#8217;t understand ourselves yet. We pick a big school because it&#8217;s where our father went, and we find that we don&#8217;t like the scale and pace only after we are living there and paying the sizable tuition. Or perhaps our guidance counselor channeled us into going there. Or our best friend picked first and we wanted to go the same place they were going. Or even we thought we knew what we wanted but, having lived a relatively sheltered life in the same home and city throughout our childhood, we didn&#8217;t know what would work for us at all.</p>
<p>Making an expensive choice that is likely to be wrong isn&#8217;t the best way to get our adult life started.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect to this. Here in the United States, most of our children and young adults have a very limited perspective of the world. Bombarded by biased media, programmed by the politics of our parents, and overly influenced by the immediate community that surrounds us, we have little idea what the world is really like and &#8211; consequently &#8211; our potential place in it.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Serve and Explore" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ServeandExplore.jpg" alt="Serve and Explore" /><br />
<figcaption>There&#8217;s a big world out there. Getting to know it will help us to better understand ourselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thanks to my upper middle class upbringing, I was able to take a three-week trip to India and Nepal as a 16 year old. It remains the most transformative experience of my life. Despite news images to the contrary, I vaguely thought that the world was suburban neighborhoods, abundances of food and goods, and not having to worry about your security. The bus ride after first landing in what we then called Bombay (today Mumbai) forever changed my view of the world. Immediately upon leaving the airport, as day was turning into night, there were people laying on the sides of the road. Lots of people. As in, hundreds if not thousands of people overall by the time we got to our hotel. That was only the first of many shocking experiences, from large packs of children begging for &#8220;chocolate&#8221;, to huge piles of feces and garbage in the streets, to scammers fooling tourists out of their money with vague illusions and &#8220;3-card monte&#8221;-style hustles in large number.</p>
<p>This India trip is an extreme example, but since then I&#8217;ve traveled much of the world, from the slums and congestion of Brazil to the soaring mountains of rural Austria. Each experience teaches me, crucially, something important. Taken altogether, what I&#8217;ve learned without question, is that what JFK once so famously said is true:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children&#8217;s future. And we are all mortal.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We are all very, very different yet we share the powerful, essential similarities cited by JFK. The cultures, beliefs and lifestyles we each have are radically different. Not only does experiencing this first-hand make these facts actually palpable and realized, it allows us to incorporate these realities deeply into our worldview and understanding. In the process, we get a great deal closer to finding ourselves.</p>
<p>So, back to serve and explore. The model that high school sophomores and juniors in today&#8217;s late starting, unchanneled world should know where they want to go to school and at least approximately what kind of program they want to go into is silly. Not only do they not know themselves very well, but they know very little about everyone else. Spending a year or two giving overseas service &#8211; be it military, civic or charitable &#8211; provides an essential window into the broader world beyond what we know in our privileged communities, and exposes us to practical, real-world skills that have relationships to jobs, industries and careers. They allow us to move beyond the books and the lectures and see what it is like to be part of a functioning system of professionals. Service in general but overseas in particular, at the point in our life where our foundation has been built and we are getting ready to blast off from that platform and into our adulthood, uniquely enables us to understand more about the world and ourselves, in ways that not only give us a better start but ultimately facilitate a better life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m glad to be alive in this day and age. My skills are generally intellectual and persuasive in nature, and they lend themselves to a knowledge economy and democratic openness. The way &#8220;the system&#8221; is built aligns pretty well with who I am. In secondary school I was identified as someone talented and a high achiever. My skills were celebrated and I received considerable validation from teachers and other administrators.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Getting a better start" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ChannelEarly.jpg" alt="Channel Early" /></p>
<figcaption>Our education system is a hammer that thinks everyone one of us is a nail. Surely, we are not.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the other hand were the lower performing students. Saddled with poor grades and branded with negative connotations, these students were taking generally the same program of study I was, yet it was clear that they were unlikely to be participants in the knowledge economy. Now, 20 years removed from high school, some of these specific peers have settled into jobs as auto mechanics, carpenters and factory workers. 1,000 years ago they would have become apprentices in a trade at a young age and received deep cultural respect; today, they were forced through an educational system of limited value to them. In the process they were made to feel diminished and unsuccessful. They were not the problem; the problem was a system that failed to account for who they uniquely are.</p>
<p>While the difference between someone who is very intellectual and someone who is very physical in their gifts is an easy example, the greater nuance lies in those with more similarities. Take five random children and someday they will grow into specific professions. Let&#8217;s for the sake of a concrete example say that they develop into a philosopher, a movie director, a software engineer, a social worker and an administrator. At what point in their lives did they start &#8220;on the track&#8221; that led them to those outcomes? Maybe the director figured it out in junior high school, because she idolized Martin Scorsese. But the education system surely did little to support her. It clicked for the philosopher as a high school senior, when they took a course on philosophy. Most high schools don&#8217;t offer this, but he got lucky. The social worker wanted to be a nurse but realized in nursing school, which can be very expensive, it was not the right fit and started over in social work. The software engineer started taking physics in university, pretty quickly realized the career potential of software engineering, and simply changed her major. Too bad she wasn&#8217;t thinking of that as a possible career much younger, as she could have been writing code for a decade already. The administrator always vaguely knew that he wanted to &#8220;go into business&#8221; and followed the channel thru undergraduate and then an MBA. It turns out his skills really aren&#8217;t tuned for executive leadership and the MBA was thus largely a waste of money. But, he ended up approximately where he always thought he would be.</p>
<p>There are many other examples we could choose. But what is notable here is, even in the best case, how late people really figured out what they were going to do, or the fact they were not supported academically in their interests until much later. Now, imagine how much different their lives would have been if:</p>
<p>- The philosopher has been identified as a big idea person at a young age, exposed to philosophy (among other intellectual topics) before high school and takes courses more germane to that future throughout those years</p>
<p>- The movie director were given a consistent thread of courses on topics like art direction, cinematography, writing and acting, alongside some more general courses</p>
<p>- The software engineer&#8217;s aptitude for math and science were identified early, and they were exposed to those type of careers at a young age. They would take courses exposing them to the applied skills and activities of those professions &#8211; at an obviously rudimentary level &#8211; and they may have found software engineering much, much earlier</p>
<p>- The social worker&#8217;s desire to help others and work in the broad medical field were compared with their skills and preferences, rooting out that they may be best actualized by more of a counseling, person-to-person relationship instead of the hands-on medical aspects of nursing. Beyond just preparatory classes they would have avoided wasting money in nursing school</p>
<p>- The administrator could have developed a far more nuanced understanding for &#8220;being in business&#8221; as a youngster, and helped to explore different roles in the context of their skills. They would have entered university with a pretty clear vision of what business as a complicated, structural context looks like and the parts they would best fit into. They either may have enjoyed a much higher trajectory in their career as a result and made the most of their MBA program, or saved the $100,000 investment altogether</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not used to thinking about channeling our young people like this. But what they would be learning would be no less age-appropriate than the general subjects they are exposed to in school today. The difference is that, instead of blindly tossing everyone into the same generic educational path we identify their diversity of preferences, skills and desires and cultivate those to give them the best possible foundation for who they are likely to become. It is a crucial aspect to getting a better start, and you can be sure the number of people who end up on the &#8220;wrong track&#8221; out of such methods will be orders of magnitude less than the poor people currently marooned and misdirected in our current, antiquated systems.</p>

<p>How old were you when you had a really crisp understanding of who you are? I was 25. I stumbled upon David Keirsey&#8217;s work, and it revealed to me &#8211; for the first time in my life &#8211; that there are structured ways of looking at and thinking about ourselves and each other. I&#8217;ve spent the next 15 years learning first about myself, then about others, and finally about the methods and frameworks in general. How old were you when you first started learning about human understanding? Have you ever really learned about it?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Begin Early" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BeginEarly.jpg" alt="Math" /></p>
<figcaption>Is learning about these things really more important than deeply understanding ourselves and one another?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is surreal that physics, calculus, European history and &#8220;Brit Lit&#8221; are core parts of our secondary school curriculum yet core aspects of the self like introversion and extraversion, or the idea of having a realistic understanding of how others see you are arcane knowledge reserved for adults who are lucky or curious enough to stumble into them. We learn very clearly what makes an apple fall to the ground but have a clumsy understanding of who we are and how we fit into the world.</p>
<p>Helping children understand who they are, and giving them language and frameworks for understanding different types of people and situations, is the most valuable knowledge we can give them. While the learnings we make in physics will benefit a miniscule percentage of our citizens, human understanding will benefit each and every one of us. While this series of articles is focused on people orienting themselves professionally &#8211; from secondary school through higher education and then onto a career &#8211; these skills also benefit us in our personal lives. And there is really no excuse not to: if we are capable of learning physics and calculus we are surely capable of some degree of inculcation in human understanding.</p>
<p>It is more than just about general education of concepts, of course. From a young age, we need to beging collecting data and documenting aspects of our development. Once there is data from a lot of people and over time, we can determine what choices people made and how successful those choices were, from a standpoint of wealth, happiness and security &#8211; among other factors. From this we will have a tapestry by which to inform our perspective of how we can best be in the world. By starting at a young age, instead of blindly thrashing until we are adults, we can have some real grounding in who and how we are from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Surely, knowing who we are is more important than memorizing the wives of Henry VIII and how each of them died.</p>

<figcaption>Not only are each of us very different, so are the various things we can end up doing in our lives.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Did you know that 80% of college students change their majors? And the average college student changes their major three times? While perhaps dismissed as &#8220;just part of the process&#8221;, it speaks to a process that is badly broken. I mean, think about it: when we are in high school we are already being driven to &#8220;choose&#8221;. That&#8217;s because the process of getting into university requires a vision and commitment when you are still just a relative child. It makes no sense, and that fooolishness plays out with people thrashing through their 18-22 years, many unable to get comfortable and making the realization that the path they picked isn&#8217;t the right one for them.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem starts even earlier than that. Our degree of self-understanding as children and young adults is generally woeful. We simply are not in touch with who we are, much less who those around us are, which leads toward us muddling through our lives. A good teacher will inspire us and take us in a direction that we are not necessarily compatible with. An enthusiastic parent will make their interests ours without consideration of what would best fit each of us. An aptitude for a particular subject is translated into something tantamount to one&#8217;s life calling &#8211; when it might not be that at all.</p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks we will look at three different ways that a re-thinking of how we treat children and young adults can lead those future citizens into lives that better resonate with their essential selves. For most of us, nothing in life is quite so wonderful as &#8220;fitting in&#8221;, whether that be with an academic program, a career, our circle of friends, or the person we choose to spend our lives with. Finding fit requires knowing ourselves. We&#8217;re going to talk about how we can help people from a much earlier age get a sense of who they are and how and where they fit.</p>

<figcaption>We may not get along, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the other person is broken.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of us assign moral failing to others who are different than us. The networker who flits their way around the social event is “superficial”. The quiet person who stays in the corner and doesn’t have much to say is “boring”. The loud person performing for a group not sensitive to the noise and space needs of people around them is “obnoxious”. The intellectual who has a critical word for seemingly everything is “arrogant”.</p>
<p>Diminishing others with such language and framing is a huge mistake that we almost universally make. We attribute to their <em>character</em> what are actually facets of their <em>inherent personality</em>. Sure, it is much easier to translate the discomfort they make us feel into some failing on their part. However, most of the time, it is not a failing by either party and instead an incompatibility between them. Indeed, each of us know other people who we “can’t stand”, yet sure enough they have friends, family, people who like and trust them. The problem isn’t them, it is the intersection between who we are, and who they are.</p>
<p>This stretches beyond personality as well. Sometimes the issue is one of territory. There can only be one CEO, so people who otherwise would get along begin seeing one another negatively because their ambitions are contradictory. Other times the issue is one of time: I am in a hurry and the other person is not. This creates conflict as we try to accomplish different things in different ways. Most of the time, in all of these cases, we turn that friction between us into a judgement of the other person. We objectify and diminish them, rather than saving blame and viewing the situation more objectively. After all, when someone blocks us or makes us feel uncomfortable, it is easier and more cathartic to say “What an a-hole!” instead of, “Ah, he’s just an extraverted intuitive.”</p>
<p>To improve your mental health and capacity for bringing goodness to the world, be aware of these judgement that you make as you go thru life. Turn the aspersions toward the other person into a recognition that you just aren’t lining up with each other. That might make you uncomfortable, but it surely does not make them bad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Cross-generational understanding" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WakeUp.jpg" alt="Wake Up" /><br />
<figcaption>When you wake up in the morning, how do you approach your day? How did your favourite grandparent?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to my mother, her father woke up every day and said &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; That is a wonderful ideal to aspire to, especially being someone who wakes up and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have xxx on my calendar today,&#8221; or some other melancholic expression about my own emerging day. On the other hand, while I am up happily working thru my creative endeavors at 2am, in the same situation he would have long since gone to bed. Culturally his approach to and taking on of the day is certainly more attractive than mine, but what I can&#8217;t figure out is whether or not it is ultimately better. Regardless of the qualitative reality of our respective states, my bigger question is: what made me so different, and how can I be more like him?</p>
<p>The problem with this question is twofold: first, the data I have on my grandfather&#8217;s life is meager, at best. I&#8217;ve never gotten to speak with much less interview people he worked with. He was a lawyer, politician, farmer, entrepreneur and oil painter. The only stories I have about him come from his children &#8211; who, like all of us, see the past in uncertain gossamer with unrealized psychic agendas &#8211; and the many stories he told me when we spent time together in my early years. These long periods together and many far-flung stories he told were less about the essential person he was and more about vignettes from his life he thought I might find entertaining, or which he was struggling to preserve in the silicon of my mind.</p>
<p>The second issue is understanding what leads us to be who we are, in the way we are. The potential divinations of the self fall across a vast chasm of a continuum, ranging from an inherently deterministic perspective giving limited weight to &#8220;nurture&#8221; and general life forces, to another extreme where every small moment of our lives smoothed or chipped us in a way to very complexly shaped us into what and who we are. The reality is likely in the middle somewhere, but within the vastness of these extremes are so many possible ways to look at a question that lacks the proper historical data to truly assess in any event.</p>
<p>All of these barriers notwithstanding, I want to figure out if it is realistic for me to transform into someone who gets out of bed announcing &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; Does the strange brew of my nature and nurture allow for it? What enabled him to frame his days in such an optimistic way? I can piece together what little I know like any armchair behavioural psychologist. But ultimately it is a vain thought exercise. Why did my father increasingly frown as he got older, and why do I feel that same frown pulling down the corners of my own mouth? Why did my predecessors live and die happily on a farm in Germany for many hundreds of years, followed by the next four &#8211; including myself &#8211; die in places far-flung from where they were born and raised?</p>
<p>Since the path to understanding these things is a mirage, the fact I aspire to discover them can certainly be dismissed as a bit of folly. But perhaps, just maybe, the data we collect over the next many generations enables my distant progeny to look back and understand their operating dynamics in ways that unlock more range in and control of their own lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve become increasingly well-versed in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(R) over the past couple of years, I keep discovering it is like an onion: the deeper you get the more layers there are. The big downside with the MBTI and the general Myers-Briggs style preference frameworks is the relative complexity. The presentation of one&#8217;s type in 16 categories using obtuse letters can be arcane for many users. The upside is, for serious analysis and study, it is much deeper than the preponderance of other tools out there. That&#8217;s why there are so many layers to keep exploring.</p>
<p>In studying my own type and behaviour, I intuitively felt there were inherent frictions between my facets, frictions that I suspected were not unique to me but common to many people of particular types. Talking about this over dinner with my friend Ann, an MBTI Master Practitioner, she acknowledged that what I was intuiting was a very real part of type dynamics. This is useful enough to provide interesting personal insights that I want to share it here.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this analysis, we are looking at how one&#8217;s Attitudes (E-I) relate to their Judging Functions (T-F) and how one&#8217;s Perceiving Functions (S-N) relate to their Lifestyle (J-P). Half of these pairing represent what I will call a &#8220;natural alignment&#8221; that lend themselves to a more comfortable natural functioning and the other half represent what I will call a &#8220;natural conflict&#8221;, providing friction for a person going through their life. Those labels are just convenient for this short post and are not suggested as formal labels to identify these characteristics beyond this.</p>
<table style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0; float: left; border: 1px solid #303030; padding: 20px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-size: 20px;" colspan="4">Naturally Aligned Pairs</td>
</tr>
<tr style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">
<td class="mbti-type-pair">E-F</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">I-T</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">S-J</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">N-P</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>E-F (Extraversion-Feeling) &#8211; getting your energy from other people, and making first judgements in people-centered ways</p>
<p>I-T (Introversion-Thinking) &#8211; getting your energy from inside yourself, and making first judgements in objective ways</p>
<p>S-J (Sensing-Judging) &#8211; perceiving the world in the moment through your senses, and making in-the-moment decisions and moving on to the next thing</p>
<p>N-P (iNtuition-Perceiving) &#8211; perceiving the world of ideas through your mind, and being compelled to delay decisions to keep options open</p>
<p>Those come together so naturally it may not be immediately apparent those short explanations are summarizing BOTH of the pairs they represent. The good news for those with strong alignment is they likely fit into the expectations of others better, and suffer less internal friction thanks to not naturally being compelled toward divergent ways of functioning. Now, look at the next list:</p>
<table style="margin: 0 20px 20px 0; float: left; border: 1px solid #303030; padding: 20px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="font-size: 20px;" colspan="4">Naturally Conflicting Pairs</td>
</tr>
<tr style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">
<td class="mbti-type-pair">E-T</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">I-F</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">S-P</td>
<td class="mbti-type-pair">N-J</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>E-T (Extraversion-Thinking) &#8211; getting your energy from other people, and making first judgments in objective ways</p>
<p>I-F (Introversion-Feeling) &#8211; getting your energy from inside yourself, and making first judgements in people-centered ways</p>
<p>S-P (Sensing-Perceiving) &#8211; perceiving the world in the moment through your senses, and being compelled to delay decisions to keep options open</p>
<p>N-J (iNtuition-Judging) &#8211; perceiving the world of ideas through your mind, and making in-the-moment decisions to close off one thing and move on to the next</p>
<p>See the contrast?</p>
<p>When your inherent preferences are thus conflicting, it is reflected in how others perceive you and how you manage yourself. For example, someone who is an E-T will seem friendly and gregarious, then will surprise you with their harsh criticism. Whereas, if an I -T were to criticize harshly you would be more likely to expect it based on other behavioural cues and natural assumptions. Or, an I-F is likely struggling inside of themselves, on one hand wanting their solitary time in order to be nurtured and replenished, while wanting to care for and deeply engage with someone else. The path forward is not simple, and gratifying either necessarily rubs the other one the wrong way. For people whose type has both pairs conflicting &#8211; ESTP, ENTJ, ISFP, INFJ &#8211; life and identity can seem particularly draining. Of course, on the flip side successful CEO&#8217;s are disproportionately ENTJs, and great artists are disproportionately ISFP&#8217;s. So while there may be a price to pay for that conflict, there are also successes and achievement borne from the trials of contradiction.</p>
<p>Of course, let us not forget that who and what we are is the product of many vectors, beyond our Myers-Briggs style preferences. So the impact of strong alignment or mis-alignment for each person can be significantly different. However, awareness of these dynamics can put us in better touch with ourselves, help us understand what is going on as we function and make decisions, and perhaps even better understand each other.</p>

<figcaption>While the Internet gives us wonderful tools to learn about people, how well are we really getting to know them?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When I am introduced to someone new the first thing I do is Google them. I&#8217;m looking for their personal website first and foremost, as well as their Twitter stream and LinkedIn page. I want to start to learn about this new person, to see connections and pathways from which we can engage with one another. Yet, even across all of those various services, I&#8217;m really getting very little. Most people don&#8217;t have personal websites. While some people are active Twitter users, far more are not. LinkedIn becomes the general &#8220;go-to&#8221; resource, but it is a remnant from our analog past: a resume with some recommendations stapled to it, now clumsily integrating information about the person&#8217;s &#8220;skills&#8221;. I&#8217;m learning little of value.</p>
<p>The richest way to explore someone is to meet them face-to-face. You can learn a lot through a simple conversation, that is not possible in any other way. But there is also much that is missed. To varying degrees we curate and prune ourselves when meeting others for the first time. Or, we end up focusing on topics or trains of thought that are &#8220;down to business&#8221; and do not end up giving much of a window into the individual. This is unfortunate. How much could we get out of our time with others if we understood them better? Not what college they went to or where they worked 10 years ago; I&#8217;m talking about who they really are, in ways that can expedite mutual understanding, productivity and value.</p>
<p>One of the many things we are trying to do with Facio is give each of us the raw materials to understand ourselves more clearly and completely, along with the ability to share that information as much or as little as we would like. Me, I&#8217;m the extreme person who is going to make all of their reports public. I want people to know exactly who they are dealing with: the positive as well as the negative. While that kind of transparency won&#8217;t be comfortable for everyone &#8211; and thus they can choose to share with just a few people or no one if they like &#8211; I have enjoyed exceptional success in my life via quickly sharing more information about myself that helps other people understand and deal with me better. It takes some courage to really go all the way with it, but it is a powerful thing. If this makes you uncomfortable, try sharing with just your family or very closest friends first. Even if you don&#8217;t want to take it any farther than that, you will almost certainly find that a greater depth of awareness and understanding is a good thing.</p>
<p>Who we are is not about our resume; it is about our personality, behaviours, motivations, preferences, skills and so much more. The better we understand ourselves and each other, the better our outcomes will increasingly become.</p>
