<figcaption>Most of time I spend checking out my iPhone is entirely unnecessary, and often even detrimental.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are a lot of things to grumble about thanks to the cultural changes smartphones are imposing on our society. People dangerously texting and driving; people not paying attention to conversations as they mechanically check their device instead; people ignoring what superficially seems their primary activity while giving attention to something less important because it comes thru their device. These are all negative byproducts of the wonderful, magical technology that gives us seemingly the entire world with the swipe of a finger or utterance of a question.</p>
<p>Beyond these more obvious negatives, the prevalence of our &#8220;always-on&#8221; culture has some more fundamentally negative impacts that, while subtle, promise to truly harm us over the long term. In the aggregate, we are less mindful and less present than we used to be. While each of these is a unique and important consideration, they also nicely overlap.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin felt mindfulness was among the most important virtues an active, thinking citizen can employ. The questions he began and ended his day with:</p>
<p>Morning: What good shall I do this day?</p>
<p>Evening: What good I have done to-day?</p>
<p>What an interesting and &#8211; at least for me and many people who I know engaged at the vanguard of technology and knowledge work &#8211; novel concept. Speaking now only for myself, I careen from one thing into the next, with little-to-no preparation or framing. My day is a cascade of crashing-into-the-next-thing. While I certainly get a lot done, some great degree of that can be ultimately considered simple churn. The quantity is significant, the <em>superficial</em> quality, as well. But thinking about Franklin&#8217;s approach to his day, I&#8217;m struck by how very much is lost.</p>
<p>While now an anachronism, there was a time where &#8211; before a pre-arranged meeting &#8211; you would reach out and &#8220;touch&#8221; the person again, both to confirm the arrangement but also reinforce the purpose. Then, after the meeting, you would think back on the interaction, apply it to a broader context, and follow up in thoughtful ways, likely sending a hand-written note. My friend Dave uses an elaborate checklist system to try and cultivate just these behaviours today.</p>
<p>More than social niceties or simple ritual, these intentional acts enable you to macerate in the person, the interaction and the shared purpose. This has two benefits. First, it makes the most out of the activity. One of my favourite movie lines is from &#8220;The Hunt for Red October&#8221;, when a wry sailor comments that they are moving so fast their sonar wouldn&#8217;t even be able to hear his daughter&#8217;s &#8211; presumably ear-splittingly loud &#8211; stereo. His concern was that they were moving so fast they were subverting the very purpose of their mission: to listen.</p>
<p>The speed with which we consume and move beyond experiences at best threatens to lessen the benefit and appreciation of those experiences, and at worst puts the purpose of the experience at risk altogether. The benefits &#8211; doing more &#8211; is offset by the reality of getting less from each. While I don&#8217;t have some magic calculus with which to precisely evaluate where the point of diminishing returns lies, I have increasingly come to believe that in most cases, slowing down and employing a more thoughtful and systematic approach will more likely provide the greater benefit for ourselves, for the other participants, and for the shared objectives overall.</p>
<p>All of this goes hand-in-hand with being present. Almost 10 years ago now, my friend Brett told me that his best professional skill was being present (Brett is a therapist). I was struck by the notion of &#8220;being present&#8221; at the time, not having thought about interactions in that way before. Of course, in the subsequent years our personal technology has made all of us ever-less present with the people around us. Whether that means other people walking on the street, a cashier at the grocery, the business colleague we are sitting next to, or our spouse telling us about their day, we choose instead to &#8220;multi-task&#8221; and give our device and the people or bits and bytes on it our attention instead.</p>
<p>The beauty of being present is that it creates deeper and more meaningful moments. Similar to being mindful, being present is about increasing the quality of experience. Particularly when I was younger &#8211; less so now that I am perpetually multi-tasking &#8211; people commented on how much I made eye contact and engaged them fully and authentically. I was instinctively being present. Now, my instinct is to <em>try</em> but it takes a great deal of effort not to swing my eyes down and read that text, queue up my email, or even skim an article on the Internet. Why on Earth am I skimming some random article that I will forget about in half an hour, rather than committing myself to the people I am physically there with?</p>
<p>As I have written about before, much of our more destructive smartphone behaviour does come down to how we use the devices, not anything inherently wrong with the devices themselves. The challenge, however, is that the way the devices work naturally taps into our addictive tendencies and literally compels us to anti-social and unproductive behaviours. These realities of the hardware and software aren&#8217;t going to change anytime soon, leaving us to struggle against a gravity well of inattention of bifurcation.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t easy solutions. Ultimately I think the devices are more good than ill, and the turbocharged lives we lead are masses of potential. However, given that theoretical potential &#8211; imagining how we could be at our best in the world empowered by these devices &#8211; we aren&#8217;t anywhere near enjoying that promise. We move too quickly without being mindful, and we give our attention to the magic box in our hand as opposed to the living people in our environment. As humans are wont to do we&#8217;ve swung from one extreme &#8211; being alone with our thoughts and temporal reality &#8211; into the opposite. Now, we are overly focused on data from devices that is often mundane and far too often not resonant. Given that there are benefits to this extreme, and the chemical rewards our bodies permit us for following the habit, making change is non-trivial.</p>
<p>As for me, I am increasingly conscious of not being mindful, and not being present, and have a growing understanding for how important those things are. I&#8217;m going to really work on my willpower, to resist the urge to give myself to the magic box. Instead I&#8217;m going to try and implement Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s method into my own life. You will certainly still catch me sneaking a peek at that shiny little screen every now and again, but if I am successful this will occur increasingly less and finally, perhaps, cease altogether.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve never liked friction. &#8220;Never liked&#8221;, in this case, has meant &#8220;avoid at all costs and become agitated if subjected to&#8221;. This has been a boon to me in creative endeavours, as my unwillingness to tolerate things that are broken is near-total and results in rigour and standards that accelerate creative goodness. However I&#8217;ve increasingly observed the positive practical impacts that friction provides in many areas of our lives and find myself, in certain ways, seeking out friction where once I would have avoided it.</p>
<p>One example of good friction is when working through challenges with other people. The healthiest outcome is almost universally achieved when all participants come in with a thick skin, intending to do the most collective good, and encouraging critical feedback from all. On the surface, this is the most friction-filled and potentially combustible way of dealing. But that is because of our personal weaknesses and character flaws. Healthy conflict is perhaps the most valuable tool we have in our interpersonal toolbox. It enables issues to be surfaced, framed and addressed. The classic passive-aggressive fear and avoidance of direct conflict might minimize short-term friction but it will reliably lead to long-term dysfunction and misalignment. Of course, to make an atmosphere of healthy conflict productive, more aggressive or self-centered people who are motivated by ego, control or other selfish motives can poison the &#8220;healthy&#8221; right out of this dynamic. Based on the relative emotional immaturity of most people today, healthy conflict is thus a very difficult thing. But it is one of the real shining examples of where friction in the immediate leads to greater strength for a longer time. It is an excellent thing.</p>
<p>Another example is physical friction. I&#8217;ve never enjoyed physically exerting myself, and from a young age learned ways to avoid doing so. For example, as a little boy, I realized how facile my feet were. Rather than bend over to pick little things up, I picked them up with my feet. Forgetting how silly I certainly looked, and that it probably took me longer than just bending over, I was side-stepping an organic opportunity to physically exercise my body. Sure, we don&#8217;t bend over a lot, so each time was just a little thing. But it is indicative of a general approach to the world that I&#8217;ve employed, really through all of my life. Even when I was an excellent high school athlete, I avoided weight lifting and anything that would provide resistance and friction &#8211; or take extra effort.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve aged, I&#8217;m feeling the consequences of this. Whereas when I was young I was very strong and capable &#8211; thanks largely to the combination of my age and boundless energy, now nearing my 40&#8242;s I&#8217;m feeling real degradation in my muscles, especially my arms and legs. Over my 39&#8242;ish years I&#8217;ve passed up certainly thousands, even tens of thousands of opportunity for resistance and friction that would have made me stronger. Now, I&#8217;m left wanting to get started at a moment when it is harder, and relative to each act will have less impact than it once would have. Lesson learned. I wonder if it would have even been possible for me to learn earlier, without experiencing it?</p>
<p>The friction in our lives often seems annoying, and in many cases completely unnecessary. We go out of our way to avoid it, simply by side-stepping conflict, or picking things up with our toes, or otherwise seeking out the path of least resistance. This is an unsurprising human trait, and one that even seems logical at first. But what we really need to do is make sure our lives are full of the appropriate amount of resistance, in the right ways. As initially counter-intuitive as it might seem, it is actually the path for us to be our best selves and contribute in the most healthy and productive ways to the groups, communities and organizations we choose.</p>

<figcaption>When you wake up in the morning, how do you approach your day? How did your favourite grandparent?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to my mother, her father woke up every day and said &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; That is a wonderful ideal to aspire to, especially being someone who wakes up and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have xxx on my calendar today,&#8221; or some other melancholic expression about my own emerging day. On the other hand, while I am up happily working thru my creative endeavors at 2am, in the same situation he would have long since gone to bed. Culturally his approach to and taking on of the day is certainly more attractive than mine, but what I can&#8217;t figure out is whether or not it is ultimately better. Regardless of the qualitative reality of our respective states, my bigger question is: what made me so different, and how can I be more like him?</p>
<p>The problem with this question is twofold: first, the data I have on my grandfather&#8217;s life is meager, at best. I&#8217;ve never gotten to speak with much less interview people he worked with. He was a lawyer, politician, farmer, entrepreneur and oil painter. The only stories I have about him come from his children &#8211; who, like all of us, see the past in uncertain gossamer with unrealized psychic agendas &#8211; and the many stories he told me when we spent time together in my early years. These long periods together and many far-flung stories he told were less about the essential person he was and more about vignettes from his life he thought I might find entertaining, or which he was struggling to preserve in the silicon of my mind.</p>
<p>The second issue is understanding what leads us to be who we are, in the way we are. The potential divinations of the self fall across a vast chasm of a continuum, ranging from an inherently deterministic perspective giving limited weight to &#8220;nurture&#8221; and general life forces, to another extreme where every small moment of our lives smoothed or chipped us in a way to very complexly shaped us into what and who we are. The reality is likely in the middle somewhere, but within the vastness of these extremes are so many possible ways to look at a question that lacks the proper historical data to truly assess in any event.</p>
<p>All of these barriers notwithstanding, I want to figure out if it is realistic for me to transform into someone who gets out of bed announcing &#8220;Today is going to be a great day!&#8221; Does the strange brew of my nature and nurture allow for it? What enabled him to frame his days in such an optimistic way? I can piece together what little I know like any armchair behavioural psychologist. But ultimately it is a vain thought exercise. Why did my father increasingly frown as he got older, and why do I feel that same frown pulling down the corners of my own mouth? Why did my predecessors live and die happily on a farm in Germany for many hundreds of years, followed by the next four &#8211; including myself &#8211; die in places far-flung from where they were born and raised?</p>
<p>Since the path to understanding these things is a mirage, the fact I aspire to discover them can certainly be dismissed as a bit of folly. But perhaps, just maybe, the data we collect over the next many generations enables my distant progeny to look back and understand their operating dynamics in ways that unlock more range in and control of their own lives.</p>

			<p>Growing up, arranged marriage was treated as a punchline. It was presented in movies and other popular culture as an outdated, senseless tradition that sought only to control the young and run contrary to American notions of freedom.</p>
<p>To be clear: no, this article will not suggest that we go back to a world of arranged marriages. People exercising their own choice to select a life partner &#8211; or even IF they select a life partner &#8211; is the more humane approach. But it is folly to discount centuries-old traditions as ignorant and senseless; we have tossed out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Indeed, in discarding arranged marriage we did away with the valuable knowledge and experience of elders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Power of Shared Knowledge" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chairs.jpg" alt="Chairs" /><br />
<figcaption>Picking the people who will best complement you is often a matter of common sense.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is a statistical fact that people with particular similarities are more likely to have lasting, successful marriages. Similar cultural backgrounds. Similar socio-economic groups. Similar religious and spiritual grounding. Complementary personality traits. In trying to espouse American values of freedom our popular culture focused on romantic comedies with quirky, unexpected, and decidedly different boy-meets-girl stories. This cheeky brand of entertainment entirely ignored the fact that these relationships are statistically less likely to work. While, certainly, wonderful relationships come out of improbable pairings the reality is a competent old-world matchmaker would probably be more likely to give you a happy pairing. It would just be with a less exotic choice, someone more like you.</p>
<p>A lot of what we do with Facio flirts with seeming to tell people what they should do. It is not our intent. We can present data, insight, statistics, probabilities. But we can&#8217;t tell you one way or another what you should do. Those choices are yours; we just want them to be more informed. We want you to make the choices, but we want to &#8211; with our modern tools and frameworks &#8211; serve the same role the wise and experienced once served when the world was slower and smaller. This brand of shared knowledge, passed from the old to the young, has been devalued on our culture. It shouldn&#8217;t be and, to what degree we are able to contribute wisdom, we surely intend to do so.</p>
