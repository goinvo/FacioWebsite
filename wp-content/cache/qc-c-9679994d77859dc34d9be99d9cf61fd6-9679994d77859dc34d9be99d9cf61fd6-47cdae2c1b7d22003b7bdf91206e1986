<figcaption>Finding alignment leads you to success &#8211; if only Charlie knew!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Are you old enough to remember the old Peanuts cartoons? The main character, Charlie Brown, was the stereotypical lovable loser. The narrative structure was set up so we would root for him even as he failed, struggled and felt sorry for himself. It was a comfortable formula that we could all identify with in ways small and large.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently referred to another of our friends as Charlie Brown, further saying that he always seems to put himself in positions that end up not working out, leading him to struggle and feel sorry for himself. This was an accurate analysis of this fine fellow but, even more, is a great example of how a lack of alignment in our lives can lead to poor outcomes and a general lack of discontent.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my friend Johnny. He is a smart, nice and remarkably resilient person. However he keeps putting himself in &#8220;no-win&#8221; positions that are destined to fail from the beginning. For example, he became an entrepreneur by building a business around his core professional skillset. But he did not add the right complementary people and resources to make the business succeed and it turned into a crushing financial failure. It was not a good fit from the beginning, and either choosing that path could have been avoided or &#8211; perhaps more powerfully &#8211; proper understanding of the dynamic could have led him to make better choices that led to a true success.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the internet it has never been easier to start a business. However, starting a business and cultivating a business are very different things. Not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. You need to be competent and at least somewhat comfortable with a wide range of skills, you need to be able to sell your butt off, and you need an unusual degree of comfort with risk and uncertainty. A minority of people can check off all these boxes; I myself barely qualify, and I&#8217;ve had a few successful companies. Yet by necessity or inspiration many people who aren&#8217;t generally well-suited for entrepreneurship choose it. Some succeed; more fail. But by better understanding ourselves as well as what skills and personality traits go into being successful we can make a more informed decision about whether we should go down that path, and how to proceed if we do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge believer in the power of context and information. It&#8217;s not that I want to tell people what to do; to the contrary, I want people to have the tools to make better decisions. If you can see that 23% of people like you were successful entrepreneurs while 91% of people like you were successful working instead inside a large law firm, you can make a more informed decision. Maybe you still hang out your own shingle, but at least you do so mindful of the gaps between who you are and what that context for success looks like. Rather than sort of arbitrarily flopping around based on limited information and understanding you can benefit from moving toward alignment between your essential self and a life that best fits you.</p>
<p>Seeing my friend be perpetually glum and careen into negative outcomes that are fairly predictable even to the naked eye, hurts. We want ourselves and the people in our lives to be successful, well, and happy. Helping them find alignment between their essential self and the choices they make in their life is a powerful gift.</p>

<figcaption>This woman might be perfect for you, but she would be terrible for me.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every day it becomes more clear to me that the daily ways we judge things as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; are inappropriate. While graduate school taught me the idea†<em>contextual</em>, functionally speaking that needs to extend to†<em>alignment</em>, or how well two or more things actually fit with each other.</p>
<p>I think my wife is terrific. In fact, removing all of the love and emotion I have for her from the equation, I struggle to imagine how someone else would functionally be a better fit for me. Now, I know very well she would not be similarly suited for every man. It just happens that her unique bend of strengths and weaknesses fit with mine in a way that provides a happy and satisfying life. We are incredibly well-aligned. There are other women who might objectively be &#8220;rated&#8221; as more desirable partners by other men. This has no relevance to me. What is important is that I found someone who fits ME. I might, because we&#8217;ve been taught to speak this way, say that &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the best wife!&#8221; But it really isn&#8217;t what I mean, nor would it be true. What I really mean is &#8220;My wife is fantastic, she is really great for ME.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thinking about and eventually re-framing the world this way is freeing. Instead of seeing jobs and people as &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; based on our framing and perception of them, it is just a question of what fits for each of us. Sure, I have personal beliefs that certain ways of behaving &#8211; eating healthier foods, treating people well, avoiding hierarchy and patriarchy in companies &#8211; are objectively better than others. And I want to espouse those things in order to, in my opinion, help people live more full, well and meaningful lives. But allowing this to saturate my worldview, and framing others in positive and negative ways is as destructive as the negative things my personal beliefs are attempting to improve.</p>
<p>For example, I pretty much think Burger King is scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of what people should be eating, for reasons of both taste and health. But, y&#8217;know, for reasons of budget or convenience or taste or just random compulsion, Burger King might be just the right thing for someone else. In that moment, for who they are and what their needs are, it fits. There is alignment between the person and that particular experience.</p>
<p>So where am I going with all of this? After all, Facio is explicitly a service endeavouring to help people achieve better outcomes, and with a particular framing of what better and worse ways of living look like. The secret here is simply shifting from the polarizing, black-and-white language and conceptions we see in partisan politics and the media to a tolerance and even acceptance of the way things and people are. Seeing my friend Baroo walk into our gaming group with a bag of Burger King and thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he is eating that crap&#8221; is counterproductive. Heckling him about it could even be destructive. It does not contribute to moving him toward what I would consider more healthy and positive outcomes. It achieves the opposite by encouraging him to defend his choice publicly and further justify it internally. After all, it represents his choice and for reasons both good and bad literally represents alignment between him and that food from Burger King. In that moment he has made his choice and it fit for him. The best way to try and change that is to make my own choice and, through living it positively and confidently, communicating a different path to him.</p>
<p>People find themselves in a remarkable diversity of moments and situations that, while more often unhealthy or suboptimal in some objective sense, correct and appropriate for who they are at the moment. There is alignment. When there is alignment between ourselves and the people, organizations and things in our life we are happier and more productive. Sure, there is a potential &#8220;better&#8221; out there for us. As John Lennon once wisely said, life is what happens while we&#8217;re busy making other plans. By accepting the present &#8211; even if and as we strive for a better future &#8211; and embracing and accepting alignment in the moment we will most certainly better from it. It is not about being best or correct; it is about what fits and works. Live on!</p>

<figcaption>Successful leadership depends greatly on the context and the needs of the people being led.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I vividly remember a happy meeting with a departing intern. I authentically celebrated her good contributions, she earnestly complimented me in ways I would not have imagined, and it was the very best of what a boss-employee parting should look like. It reminded me how much I genuinely enjoy the people I am able to work with in the right way.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the right way.&#8221; That is a complicated little turn-of-phrase. You see, I am extremely introverted in ways that create interpersonal challenges. I dislike large group settings: although I am able to perform admirably on demand, in the context of an everyday work environment, I don&#8217;t and can seem cold and distant. I also dislike inauthentic interactions: when I am able to &#8220;dive deep&#8221; with someone and pay attention to them while they pay attention to me, my relationships are very powerful. However, when the time involved or nature of the interaction is more superficial, I become impatient. Which, again, can make me seem cold and distant.</p>
<p>This particular employee called me a &#8220;great leader&#8221; and that she could not imagine a boss would eschew a hierarchical relationship and be so warm, engaging and directly involved in her well-being and development. This, of course, is the most humbling and appreciated feedback I could possibly get. But so many past people I&#8217;ve worked with would guffaw at the words &#8220;great leader&#8221;, because they knew me in a different context that was less in my wheelhouse for success, or even when I was younger and less developed as a person. While it was joyous to hear those words and know they were authentic and even reasonable for that particular person, I am under no illusion that I am a great leader. I can be, and sometimes am. More often I am, like most people, performing in ways that range from adequate to very good. Rarely great and rarely terrible, I&#8217;m doing my best in contexts that are uncomfortable and with people that I may or may not fit well with.</p>
<p>One of the secrets to being the most of who we can be &#8211; with &#8220;most&#8221; being more of a qualitative than quantitative descriptor &#8211; is understand how and why you thrive and putting yourself into those positions. My particular weaknesses do not translate well to effective leadership in a traditional sense, but each day I am trying to tune myself as well as my contexts in order to more reliably and repeatably be participating in situations that could result in people seeing me as a great leader. Of course I want to be; I just also want to remain resonant with my essential self.</p>
<p>For others, your limitations and strengths and comfort levels are unique and, in most cases, vastly different from mine. The secret for each of us is to get in touch with these things and design our lives to resonate with the best and strongest parts as much as we can. From there we will not just become potentially great leaders, but people living better lives.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve now been certified in four of the leading personality methodologies and have studied dozens more. One of the best are the Hogan Assessments, which use three different reports to cover your strengths, &#8220;derailers,&#8221; which are the areas you will likely manifest negative characteristics, and values. In its breadth covering a variety of important areas, the Hogan is one of the most useful tools on the market.</p>
<p>Of course, like seemingly every provider in the human understanding industry, their visualizations often muddy the waters they are attempting to navigate. A good example of that is with the &#8220;derailers&#8221; report, and what they call the &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;.</p>
<p>The formal name of the &#8220;derailers&#8221; is the HDS, or <a href="http://www.hoganassessments.com/assessments-hogan-development-survey" target="_blank">Hogan Development Survey</a>. It endeavours to identify &#8220;personality-based performance risks and derailers of interpersonal behaviour.&#8221; And indeed, the report itself is typically seen as forbidding by the people receiving it. The red bars have a decidedly negative connotation, and when you are getting your report and seeing a lot of red, like an exam at school when we were younger, it is most certainly not a good thing. Indeed, there is nothing in the report to refute this, with the larger red lines explicitly communicating higher risk. It seems very black-and-white (and red!): either you have a lot of red and are &#8220;good&#8221;, or not much red and are &#8220;bad&#8221;. If you are somewhere in the middle, you glance over the smaller red bars and focus on the larger red bars.</p>
<figure style="width: 400px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" title="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg" alt="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" width="400" /></a></p>
<figcaption>Can you guess where to find my &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shame of it is, this very specific report design does not reinforce the actual story the tool is telling. You see, red bars in the third level &#8211; the one next-to-highest and called moderate risk &#8211; are actually seen as a positive when evaluating candidates. Hogan calls them &#8220;the jewels of personality&#8221;. As my certification instructor taught, you want to see some of these in one&#8217;s report. They represent their personality, the parts of them that will be unique, interesting and have the potential to provide real value. Considering my own report, my excitability does contribute to the charisma I am able to turn on when the situation calls for it, and certainly my high imaginative is woven into many of the best skills that I have. It is accurate. And yes, even though my excitability in particular can be more of a derailer for me, it is as much or more of a strength than a weakness.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in this report reinforcing that. Yes, sure, your interpreter may explain this to you during the process. However I&#8217;ve witnessed how it can be &#8220;in one ear, and out the other&#8221;. For many people, all they are seeing are the red bars. And it is very black-and-white. Big red = bad, little red = good. The report is built that way. It is not just obtuse; it is unfortunate. The jewels of personality are left waiting to be found.</p>
<p>How better to design this tool? From a risk perspective, there are only three things that matter: no/low risk (green light), moderate risk (yellow light) and high risk (red light). For no/low risk, they really don&#8217;t even need to be mentioned. They are only marginally relevant to the person being assessed &#8211; if they are curious about the methodology there are other ways to learn it than valuable space on the core report &#8211; and their relevance to an organization is only in a specific context, such as a situation where a position could tolerate some types of risks but not others. It is the moderate and high risks that matter, the former something to keep in mind and the latter something to vet. But then there are the positives from this report, the jewels. Notably these don&#8217;t come out in any of the other Hogan reports, they just hide here. They should be brought out, focused on, perhaps even the first and primary part of this report. So, the primary focus are the moderate risks &#8211; called something more akin to their very clever and cute &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221; label &#8211; then the high risk should be the second focus and the no/low risk virtually no focus at all. Instead, this report deafens you with indeterminate bars of red.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t decided if this is an article about poor report construction in the psychological assessment industry or the fact many of our &#8220;riskiest&#8221; traits can also be those that make us most interesting and valuable. Both of those points are true and on clear display with the Hogan HDS and its conspicuously absent jewels of personality.</p>

<p>Your best and most valuable employees are also the hardest to ultimately keep. That&#8217;s because the same things that make them so effective for you make them most desirable to the market and less tolerant to survive in a situation not commensurate with the high esteem they likely have for themselves. Since these are the people who create the most value for your organization this is not only frustrating but deserving of the highest strategic importance.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some tips to consider when thinking about how to best attract and retain top talent:</p>
<p>1. Make sure they are fairly compensated. The reality is that the best people know what they are capable of making, and what they are willing to take in the right situation. Trying to employ efficiency methods to constrain their compensation &#8211; a tactic which can work for younger employees and lesser performers &#8211; will surely lead top people to leave sooner or later.</p>
<p>2. Care about their development. While some of their development can and should be focused on how they benefit your company, you also need to help them grow in ways that will not clearly plug into your organization. They want to feel empowered and encouraged, not controlled and directed. Be proactive in helping them figure out where they want to go with their lives and contributing to their process of getting there.</p>
<p>3. Provide transparency. Top performers want to feel like they know what is going on, and have the ability to evaluate for themselves whether authority figures are making good decisions. You do not need to publicly share every shred of company information; what you must do is let them know that most information is available to be shared, then be prepared to share it if they ask to do so. While this seems like the potential to be a distraction, in reality an employee who is incessantly asking to see information likely isn&#8217;t the sort of high performer you want to keep anyway.</p>
<p>4. Allow them to be involved in decision making. Even if they don&#8217;t have the last word, they expect to be genuinely listened to and have their input factored into the final decision. Make sure they are in an environment and under a manager that is inviting of their input.</p>
<p>5. Trust them. These are different times, with flex hours, working from home and a remote workforce now the standard in more progressive companies and industries. The best people will often have expectations that would have seemed ridiculous even a decade ago, and very well might make you uncomfortable. Well, tough. This is the new normal. If you want to keep them and get the best out of them, you need to take a deep breath and trust them. Most high performers, and all truly exceptional employees, are deserving of your trust.</p>
<p>One easy way to think about your key employees is how you would a romantic partner. If you truly want to be with them long-term you need to invest with the relationship and &#8211; crucially &#8211; give them space, control and consideration. You must see them as their own people who will be less likely to leave if you reinforce, and even encourage, their freedom to do exactly that.</p>
