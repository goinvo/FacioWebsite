				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week we looked at the three big questions you should be asking yourself in order to make the best choices about your career. This week we will talk about when and why you should prioritize each of them.</p>
<p>While, ideally, all three of these things would be satisfied by the position we are currently in, this degree of alignment is unfortunately uncommon in the world today. So you should focus on making sure that two of them are being met, if at all possible. Here are the three combinations, and situations compatible with each:</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing? What do I want from my job?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This combination removes the ambition aspect. If you are not future-focused on your professional life, or not really into &#8220;a career&#8221;, you should focus on these two things. Performing tasks every day that you enjoy or, at least, don&#8217;t mind makes &#8220;work&#8221; something more than a four-letter word. It is worth holding out for this. Then, make sure your needs are being met by your employer. We all work for different reasons. For some of us, it is all about the Benjamins. For others, it is about working with people we like and being treated with respect. Actually, it is never just one thing. But figure out what the most important things are for you and get them.</p>
<p>The bottom line with this combination is to spend your day doing things you like, and make sure you are getting the rewards and treatment you need from your employer.</p>
<p>2. What do I want to be doing? Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2_2.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, you are least concerned with compensation, recognition and environmental aspects, focused on the things your job will have you do, and how it can position you for the future. In this case, you have a clear vision of where you want to go in the long run, and you are very focused on getting the experience and skills necessary to ascend to that point. While title is often important in these cases as well, you are largely foregoing a focus on compensation or ego needs in exchange for taking something you think is just what you need to advance.</p>
<p>This is a good combination for young professionals, or for people reinventing themselves mid-career, or people with highly specific professional goals. This is how interns or apprentices should be thinking, aligning their day-to-day with the future in front of them.</p>
<p>3. What do I want from my job? Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2_3.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is the most future-focused configuration, as you de-prioritize the importance of what your job asks you to do and just make sure it has you on the proper long-term career path. Salary is often particularly important to this group as growing in one&#8217;s career is usually accompanied by ratcheting up your standard of living. In other cases, incentives such as the right title to be leveraged in the future, or working with or for famous or accomplished individuals and companies are big factors in making a decision. After all, if your job is to get Stephen Spielberg&#8217;s coffee, but if you&#8217;re able to negotiate a title like &#8220;Assistant Producer&#8221; in the deal, you&#8217;ve now worked on a movie with Stephen Spielberg. Needless to say there are worse things for one&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>This is the terrain of the ambitious or just people very committed to &#8220;getting ahead&#8221; from where they are now. By focusing on that future, and your personal needs in the process, you can create the best chance to realize success.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t take this article to mean I don&#8217;t think you should try and have it all. Being mindful about these three aspects is the first step to achieving the proverbial &#8220;dream job&#8221;. However, from a practical perspective, unless your financial situation gives you no other choice, always ensure you are meeting at least two of these needs. It will help work to be a healthier part of your life, contribute to greater overall well-being, and put you in control of the impact your work has upon your life.</p>

<figcaption>Actively thinking about what you are looking for professionally will help your life better align with your needs and desires.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When thinking about your career, there are three primary tensions that must be reconciled to crate satisfaction for yourself professionally:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing?</p>
<p>I remember at the start of my career, I didn&#8217;t really care what I was doing. I just wanted to get paid! As I got more experience, it became clear what I did &#8211; or, more frequently &#8211; did not want to do. For example, I learned that did not want to be a line cook. Or fill, pack and ship boxes. Or be a legal assistant. Or be a bartender. On the other hand, I kind of liked being a ghost writer. And I REALLY loved betting on horses at the track to make money, but my conservative middle class upbringing insured that I never seriously entertained spending my professional life doing that!</p>
<p>Today, as an almost-fortysomething, I have a very clear idea of what I want to be doing and not doing. Writing, research, creative direction, executive leadership: yes. Sales, service, administration: no. Having a crisp understanding of what I do and do not want to do empowers me to make better decisions about jobs I want to take &#8211; or not.</p>
<p>2. What do I want from my job?</p>
<p>Money, title, responsibilities, benefits, perks, recognition, flex time, autonomy&#8230;the many things that aren&#8217;t literally what we do but critically frame our satisfaction in doing it. We learn that money and title are the big ones to negotiate for yet &#8211; while they are important &#8211; it is the other things that often cause us to leave or love what we are doing. As with the first point, these are very personal. For example, I am now accustomed to being an entrepreneur. For the last decade I&#8217;ve worked for myself. While I can see myself again working for someone else, now I would need some set of responsibilities, some domain over which I am the final decision maker. That&#8217;s vital to me. And far more than money or title, having that is the &#8220;dealbreaker&#8221;. It took me a long time to know that about myself. When I was younger, what I wanted out of the job was far less apparent to me and manifested in money or title. I still didn&#8217;t know myself, and that opacity also obfuscated my ability to figure out what I really wanted out of what I was doing.</p>
<p>3. Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<p>This can also be called the &#8220;ambition factor&#8221;: for those who want to be a corporate CEO, it is huge. For those who like doing illustration and don&#8217;t want to do anything else, it can be largely irrelevant. It is about looking into the future and having an idea of where you hope to later be. This is another one that changes as we grow. In my case, when I first started my career, I had no sense of a specific place I wanted my career to end up at. Once I started getting on a track, however, I got the very specific notion of running my own company. This eventually transferred to the company itself, and having ideas about what I wanted that company to be. Finally, now that I&#8217;ve &#8220;made it&#8221;, this is a very small consideration for me. I don&#8217;t have any ego needs left here. And, I&#8217;ve reached a level and stature in my career where I should be able to &#8220;get a job&#8221; that pays a lot at any point. I don&#8217;t need to keep rising to create financial protection for myself and my family. Barring a total collapse of the economy and society, I&#8217;ve done all I need to do from the standpoint of ambition.</p>
<p>Next week we will take these three factors and talk about how you can balance them in making good decisions for yourself in your own career.</p>

			<p>The older I get, the more deeply I value the role of specialist coaches and consultants to get the most out of our people and organization.</p>
<p>At first, investing in a coach or consultant can seem expensive. Comparing their hourly rate to what you could hire someone for, or going down the logic trail of &#8220;I pay Bob big bucks already, if I need to pay these rates to a coach to get Bob on track then why is Bob here in the first place?&#8221; is a self-destructive exercise. Consider:</p>
<p>First, each of us have strengths and weaknesses. So it is likely that many of us are in roles where our strengths are not being optimized and our weaknesses further exposed. Or, if we are, our weaknesses are going to spring up from time-to-time. The expectation that we should just be plug-and-play effective is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Next, none of us are perfect. We have good days and bad; even good and bad weeks or months. While the &#8220;bad&#8221; periods are certainly not good for anyone &#8211; including our employer who presumably keeps paying us regardless &#8211; they should be expected. &#8220;Bob&#8221; in my above example may be struggling, but our simply expecting him to suck it up and improve since we&#8217;re paying him isn&#8217;t consistent with reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, improving and actually contributing more than we are otherwise able takes an investment. This might be an investment of time or money, but either way something different needs to happen to be a catalyst for, well, different things starting to happen! Expecting it to happen through osmosis or because someone is given a pep talk (or development plan) is scattershot and puts the success or failure outside of your hands as a manager or employer.</p>
<p>The great thing about a strong coach is that they bring the total package to the table: it is their time that goes into managing the development; it is their specialized expertise that makes the most of the development; it is their experience doing this with many other people that makes it likely the development is going to succeed.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Coaches: a smart investment" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Coach_300.jpg" alt="Coaches: a smart investment" /><br />
<figcaption>When we hear the word &#8220;coach&#8221; it might conjure up images of someone with a whistle, but professional coaches can transform your employees and business.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I remember an employee who once worked for me. An extremely hard-working fellow, very nice and generally capable, he just didn&#8217;t seem able to &#8220;make it happen&#8221; in the things we were expecting of him. And, we didn&#8217;t really know how to properly guide or necessarily manage him. Despite the fact he was jut the kind of person we wanted in our organization, we were frustrated with him. We talked about letting him go. We couldn&#8217;t understand why he didn&#8217;t just &#8220;make it happen.&#8221; Instead of letting our frustration take us to the point of letting him go, we doubled down and provided him with a coach. He immediately began to excel. The coach&#8217;s combination of management attention and domain-specific guidance and expertise was transformative. Not only did his performance significantly improve, the coach told us he&#8217;s one of the strongest employees he&#8217;s ever worked with, an absolute model.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#8217;t made the investment in the coach, it would have ended very differently. And, we paid less for the coach than paying a recruiter to replace our employee &#8211; with someone who likely would not have been the same kind of star &#8211; would have cost. Literally everyone won as the company&#8217;s bottom line benefitted, our culture was burgeoned from re-investing in someone everyone liked, and the employee&#8217;s potential was fully unlocked in way that were not just beneficial to success in his role but also to him personally.</p>
<p>This is just one example, but it really illustrates the power a good coach can have. Yes, the hourly rate might seem high. Yes, our intuition might be that the employee should just &#8220;suck it up&#8221; and &#8220;get the job done&#8221;. These are just bad excuses. The investment in a good coach or consultant is an investment of vision. It is one of those uncommon things that is likely to have a positive impact on both your short-term bottom line and your long-term culture and employee wellness. If you have an employee who is generally a good fit, double-down on unlocking their potential.</p>

			<p>The differences between &#8220;morning people&#8221; and &#8220;night people&#8221; are significant, as is the way they intersect with one another and their employer.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Morning and Night" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Morning-Night_300.jpg" alt="Morning Night" /></p>
<figcaption>The time of day you are at your best may suggest more about you than you realize.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Morning people tend to be more optimistic, physically energetic and proactive. Night people tend to be more intelligent, creative and have a better sense of humour. As always, these generalities are not true for all members of the group. While each of these types have clear advantages, the biggest impact of any of these things is the fact that morning people&#8217;s natural rhythms are aligned with the 9-5 professional world, while night people&#8217;s are not. Research has shown that, as a direct result of these issues of chronotype, morning people do better in school, have access to better institutes of higher learning, get better jobs, and enjoy more lucrative career arcs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty massive impact on our life outcomes! Now, step back and consider it from a societal perspective: if night people are generally more intelligent, but morning people are getting the better access to superior learning and work opportunities, we are by definition using our available resources inefficiently. Thanks to what is essentially thousands of years of inertia around structuring our societies around the daylight &#8211; after all, the electric light is less than 150 years old as an established technology &#8211; our societal systems support and reward morning people while punishing night people. We have not shifted the rhythm of systems and organizations to match how people live, instead naturally preserving the way it has always been done.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions. Not surprisingly, they are exceptions created by the marketplace. Once it became possible to have factory workers work day and night, shifts were added so the workers would go day and night. This was done because the benefits were obvious, and quantifiable: enabling people to produce at all hours of the day increases profits for the employer. These industries at this point have reached an even more sophisticated level of maturity, no longer just going flat-out at all times but crafting schedules that reflect when their people are most productive. All of this is easy, because the benefits are transparent.</p>
<p>While it is clumsy to claim that having the smarter people get the better opportunities would lead to better organizational success and profits &#8211; who knows, perhaps optimism is more important than intelligence? &#8211; it is immediately clear that having the preponderance of societal organizations catering to morning people at the expense of night people is illogical. Technology has rendered such coarse methods obsolete. If our systems didn&#8217;t try to jam night people into the rhythms of the morning people, what potential would that unlock? How would it improve their lives? How would they contribute more and better? Even though these are not easily quantifiable, our society and its citizens would clearly benefit from more flexible systems that work for both the people of the morning, and the people of the night.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m going to turn 40 this year. Beyond symbolically being &#8220;in the middle&#8221;, it puts me square in the middle of two very different ways of looking at the work world.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="People Leave" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PeopleLeave.jpg" alt="People Leave" /><br />
<figcaption>Trying to prevent people from leaving, or punishing them for doing so, is a sign of poor management.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I grew up being taught that you should find a good company, give them your best effort for 40&#8242;ish years, be well rewarded, then retire and live The Good Life of laying around and taking up a hobby. The reality of today&#8217;s workplace is that people search for opportunities that provide the right experience and/or lifestyle, then are quick to seek out and move into positions elsewhere that are better fits for the life they want to live. It took me a couple of jobs to shift from seeing work as &#8220;married forever&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s mostly about me&#8221;. The changes are a good thing, but some of our thinking remains mired in the older, outmoded ways.</p>
<p>Recently one of my employees left Facio. He was an outstanding contributor and very strong cultural fit. However, another company more mature than us recognized his excellence and offered him 50% more salary and going from overseeing a team of two others to overseeing a team of 30 others. It greatly accelerated his career arc, and more rapidly put him in a position that aligned with the breadth of impact he wants to have. While terribly disappointed to lose him, I was thrilled for the chance he was being given.</p>
<p>Often times we do not have that open-minded reaction. More than once, I&#8217;ve seen reactions to an announced departure range from anger to betrayal to disgust. Not only does it not honour the person who is leaving, it is entirely counter-productive. Other employees seeing an adverse reaction to a departure are learning how the employer treats other employees, and take for granted they may be subjected to the same negativity. It lowers morale, decreases loyalty and can have a chilling impact on the environment. Treating people positively and supportively is better for your company, better for them, and ultimately better for you. Positive emotions are proven to increase the quality and length of our lives.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: people leave. Sometimes you want them to; other times you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you are surprised; other times you see it coming. Sometimes they are leaving at a clean and comfortable moment; other times it is exceedingly messy and inconvenient. Regardless of the particular circumstances, expecting that people are (all!) going to leave should be a given, and making their departure as positive it can be given the specific circumstances is the best thing you can do in your role for your employer and for yourself as a citizen.</p>
