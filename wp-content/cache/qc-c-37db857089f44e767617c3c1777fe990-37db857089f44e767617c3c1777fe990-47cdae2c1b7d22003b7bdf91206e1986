				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personality (n.) - The combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual&#8217;s distinctive character.</p>
<p>It seems pretty simple. But dictionary definitions aside, our notions of personality are either incomplete, or dictated by the conceptual models provided by different people or organizations. Incomplete, because we equate characteristic such as extraversion as being personality. They may be a part of it, but they surely are not all of it. That is easy enough to understand.</p>

<p>The relationship between personality and conceptual models is a fair bit more difficult to untangle. These models &#8211; things like the four-letter personality type designed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers and the DISC method of William Marston &#8211; are helpful aids in providing us with understanding. One of the wonderful benefits of these tools is providing structure that lead to understanding. I warmly remember being first exposed to such methods in my mid-20&#8242;s via the work of David Keirsey. Whereas, up to that point, much of my understanding of others was that they were &#8220;nice&#8221; or &#8220;aggressive&#8221; or &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;quiet&#8221;, suddenly I had a more sophisticated vocabulary. More than that, I had a framework within which I fit, where I could &#8220;see&#8221; myself and &#8211; in resonating with the things that I read &#8211; feel empowered. As time went on and I learned more it also helped me to understand others.</p>
<p>These are lovely things, all. But there are problems. None of these frameworks agree with each other. There is truth to be gleaned from each of them, but which is &#8220;right&#8221;? If one is ultimately correct in any discernable way we will likely have a hard time figuring out which one, as the creators or licensees of each advocate their own to further personal gain. Unfortunately, research universities largely stay away from applied personality frameworks which is indeed a shame, as some greater level of objectivity and rigour may be offered by those organizations.</p>
<p>Yet, discerning truth is the least of it. A larger issue is the closing down of how we look at and interpret the world. As empowering as these frameworks initially are, and as helpful as they can prove to be, they also lock our thinking into them. We see the world as ENTP&#8217;s, or as DC&#8217;s, or as 2-2-1-1&#8242;s. Practitioners as well as normal individuals associate themselves with one method or another and use that as their lens to understand personality. While each of those conceptions are interesting and useful, they are also limiting. None offers a complete picture, and they teach us to translate our understanding of others into their idiosyncratic form. It is not a completely bad thing, there are many good things about the tools. But they naturally keep us from thinking beyond their bounds both because of the benefits they provide, and the bounds themselves.</p>
<p>So by all means, learn about personality models. Learn from the smart work that has been done, discover yourself, develop tools to understand others. But don&#8217;t let that be the only language you speak in and think about this vitally important thing, personality. Stay open-minded. Learn about other methods. Nuance both your understanding and interpretation. It is the next step to greater enlightenment in the complicated world of human understanding.</p>
