			<p>The thing I find most remarkable about popular literature and dogma about leadership is how it takes a “one size fits all” approach. While certainly convenient for minting best-sellers, filling headlines and providing pithy catchphrases, the reality is different situations require significantly different types of leaders.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Great Leadership" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/GreatLeadership.jpg" alt="Phone" /><br />
<figcaption>Each situation is different, and rarely does a “one-size-fits-all” solution belong.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, the transparency required to run a bleeding edge consumer software firm today directly clashes with the delicate privacy required when leading an old, tradition-laden financial institution. The nature of the organizations require different approaches to information. Or, that the “lead the leaders” skills required to be exceptional running a large organization is ineffective in a start-up, which requires hands-on execution, hustling and leading by example. Or, that the command and control style that can be effective when getting productivity out of unmotivated laborers falls flat when trying to get the most out of curious creatives.</p>
<p>This is not rocket science; it is actually pretty simple logic. Yet the sources offering knowledge continue to favor the “one side fits all” approach. In order to grow, to be great leaders and managers, we need to be aware of our context. The right or best approach or set of skills for succeeding in one situation most certainly won’t prove effective in many others. So the next time you read the latest breathless press about the latest fad leadership method, read about it with a critical eye: what are the right situations to take this approach or exercise these skills? If I try to develop myself, and emulate the strategies being suggested by the gurus, will they prove effective in my unique situation?</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is what works in your specific context: you, your company, and the people requiring leadership. No two situations are quite the same and, while so-called best practices might have some value for you, the best overall solution is one firmly grounded in your particular experience.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I recently read a story about maligned Detroit Lions football player Ndamukong Suh. After an ugly incident where he stomped on another player, Suh has subsequently been attached to other unflattering stories, including a road rage incident and – maybe accidentally, maybe intentionally – kicking an opposing player in the groin. He is derided as the “most hated” player in the National Football League by his fellow players.</p>
<p>Now, I do not have enough information about Suh to comment on whether he is misunderstood or really deserving of the ire. However, in reading a thoughtful article that made the case he is, in fact, misunderstood there was an inadvertent focus on his being introverted. Many introverted people express feeling misunderstood, and Suh is no exception. He said:</p>
<p><em>“There’s no question that statement from my mom is accurate. If I want to share something with you, I’ll share it with you, but don’t try to pull anything out of me because that’s when you’ll get the opposite effect. I don’t openly rebel. I quietly rebel. My mom is one of the few people who knows how to maneuver around my personality to get the answers she wants. But for everyone else, that’s just the way I am. You’re gonna have to either take it or leave it.” </em></p>
<p>I like how he used the word “maneuver” here. The essence of getting along well with other people is understanding them well enough to know how you should move and around them. It is like dancing except – whereas in dancing you have very specific and generally objective steps – interacting smoothly with others is closer to black magic. The reason is we just don’t know each other well enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Maneuver and Dance" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Maneuver-and-dance2.jpg" alt="Phone" /><br />
<figcaption>Gracefully moving with and around one another is essential to strong relationships.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Suh’s mother maneuvers around him successfully because she knows him as well as anyone. She watched him grow up, perhaps seeing the same things in herself, or Suh’s father, and leverages her knowledge to co-exist with him better. However, when Suh gets in other situations with people who don’t know him as well, the opportunity for misunderstanding, discomfort and disconnection becomes ripe. While his being a complicated person might exacerbate the issue, we routinely misunderstand and dance clumsily with each other every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few things feel as good or are rewarding as knowing people well enough that we dance seamlessly with them during our time together. The challenge is, getting there typically requires a good deal of time together, along with vulnerability and trust. These things are not easy individually, much less altogether. It is why we ultimately resonate with so few people, and our lives are ostensibly laced with suboptimal relationships and moments. At Facio, our core mission is helping people understand each other. The things we are building and doing are designed specifically with that in mind. We want people to understand each other, to dance gracefully with each other, and maneuvering around our essential selves in nimble and considerate ways.</p>

<p>Last night I had dinner with a woman who told the story about a hiring decision she was involved with. She felt strongly that the person being considered would not work out but the CEO decided to hire them anyway. 9 months later, at great cost to the organization in time, cost and opportunity, the candidate washed out. recounting the story, She shook her head and rolled her eyes. While I don’t know the gritty details of this particular situation, it reminded me of similar rueing in my own career.</p>
<p>The first person I was part of the hiring team for bringing on washed out mere months after being hired. This individual was hired for an “account manager” position. The organization doing the hiring – to which I was new – had an imbalanced sales culture. This person was to be the first account manager in the organization. There were three of us who were making the decision together: myself, who was hired to, among other things bring an account services structure to the organization, and two other, long-time executives. They were both parts of that old, established sales culture.</p>
<p>The candidate we were considering had a long and seemingly strong background in cold sales while carrying an “account manager” title. He was perfect for what our organization used to be. The problem was, I could tell he would not be a good account manager. Now, I was young, this was the first hire that I was a part of making, and I was trying to be respectful of my colleagues. When I raised my concerns about his poor fit for account management, their response was “Yeah, but he can really sell!” I caved, we hired him, and his tenure with the company was ugly. As it turns out he couldn’t even sell. And he certainly couldn’t manage an account.</p>
<p>If I had more courage, or conviction, maybe I could have steered things in a different way. I was in the organization to facilitate change, so maybe a stronger hand would have saved the organization a loss in time, money and opportunity. But I didn’t, and we didn’t, and the results were ugly.</p>
<p>Another example was when my first entrepreneurial company, what became Involution Studios Silicon Valley, crashed and died. In late 2008, I saw the problems coming. And I knew how to avoid them: cut quick and cut deep. My business partner didn’t have the stomach for that. Now, he suggested another path that would have been much better than what ended up happening – just shutting down completely and taking our large war chest in the company to secure a soft landing for ourselves and go onto something else. But I didn’t want to kill the company, he didn’t want to cut 60% of the staff after a huge 2008, and instead we made the cardinal sin of cutting slowly and gradually over time, not making anyone happy and eventually destroying the company entirely. And, in that scenario, we not only didn’t have a soft landing but I was almost ruined financially.</p>
<p>I knew the right thing to do was cut quick and cut deep. I had even counseled clients to do exactly that when I was a consultant. But when it came down to two people – myself and my partner – both with strong opinions, I wasn’t able to get us on the right path. What if I had really dug in my heels? What if we had some big, screaming arguments? Could we have gotten there? Could that company still be a power today? Could the experience have been much better for us and protected and honored our very best employees who would have been cultivated in that scenario?</p>
<p>There is no way to know. But, in each of our careers, there will be various times when we think we know better. When we have an insight, or just an opinion, that we strongly think is the better path to take. It is our responsibility to ourselves, our employers and our colleagues to advocate our position as thoroughly and vigorously as we possibly can. If you keep quiet, or don’t go to the mattresses, and things go the other way, don’t you dare say “I told you so”. Don’t console yourself with “If only people listened to me…” If people don’t listen to us, if we can’t convince them of our position, if we can’t help move things toward the better decision, that is our fault. Either because we lacked the courage to really assert our position, or because we have allowed our influence to be minimized in the organization to the point where we couldn’t steer the decision, or because we didn’t take the time to craft the proper argument and move the necessary people.</p>
<p>So stop being one of the majority of people who shake their head and pile up their “I told you so’s”. Roll up your sleeves and do your utmost to move things the way you think they should be. I for one truly regret the handful of times when I did not honor myself and do my utmost to steer decisions toward better outcomes. Now, if I think something is important, I’m going to be out there fighting for it. It might not go my way, but I surely won’t need to harbor any “I told you so’s”: it is going to be crystal clear to everyone where I came down on the issue. Without question my companies and the decisions they make are and will continue to be the better for it.</p>

<figcaption>Most of time I spend checking out my iPhone is entirely unnecessary, and often even detrimental.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are a lot of things to grumble about thanks to the cultural changes smartphones are imposing on our society. People dangerously texting and driving; people not paying attention to conversations as they mechanically check their device instead; people ignoring what superficially seems their primary activity while giving attention to something less important because it comes thru their device. These are all negative byproducts of the wonderful, magical technology that gives us seemingly the entire world with the swipe of a finger or utterance of a question.</p>
<p>Beyond these more obvious negatives, the prevalence of our &#8220;always-on&#8221; culture has some more fundamentally negative impacts that, while subtle, promise to truly harm us over the long term. In the aggregate, we are less mindful and less present than we used to be. While each of these is a unique and important consideration, they also nicely overlap.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin felt mindfulness was among the most important virtues an active, thinking citizen can employ. The questions he began and ended his day with:</p>
<p>Morning: What good shall I do this day?</p>
<p>Evening: What good I have done to-day?</p>
<p>What an interesting and &#8211; at least for me and many people who I know engaged at the vanguard of technology and knowledge work &#8211; novel concept. Speaking now only for myself, I careen from one thing into the next, with little-to-no preparation or framing. My day is a cascade of crashing-into-the-next-thing. While I certainly get a lot done, some great degree of that can be ultimately considered simple churn. The quantity is significant, the <em>superficial</em> quality, as well. But thinking about Franklin&#8217;s approach to his day, I&#8217;m struck by how very much is lost.</p>
<p>While now an anachronism, there was a time where &#8211; before a pre-arranged meeting &#8211; you would reach out and &#8220;touch&#8221; the person again, both to confirm the arrangement but also reinforce the purpose. Then, after the meeting, you would think back on the interaction, apply it to a broader context, and follow up in thoughtful ways, likely sending a hand-written note. My friend Dave uses an elaborate checklist system to try and cultivate just these behaviours today.</p>
<p>More than social niceties or simple ritual, these intentional acts enable you to macerate in the person, the interaction and the shared purpose. This has two benefits. First, it makes the most out of the activity. One of my favourite movie lines is from &#8220;The Hunt for Red October&#8221;, when a wry sailor comments that they are moving so fast their sonar wouldn&#8217;t even be able to hear his daughter&#8217;s &#8211; presumably ear-splittingly loud &#8211; stereo. His concern was that they were moving so fast they were subverting the very purpose of their mission: to listen.</p>
<p>The speed with which we consume and move beyond experiences at best threatens to lessen the benefit and appreciation of those experiences, and at worst puts the purpose of the experience at risk altogether. The benefits &#8211; doing more &#8211; is offset by the reality of getting less from each. While I don&#8217;t have some magic calculus with which to precisely evaluate where the point of diminishing returns lies, I have increasingly come to believe that in most cases, slowing down and employing a more thoughtful and systematic approach will more likely provide the greater benefit for ourselves, for the other participants, and for the shared objectives overall.</p>
<p>All of this goes hand-in-hand with being present. Almost 10 years ago now, my friend Brett told me that his best professional skill was being present (Brett is a therapist). I was struck by the notion of &#8220;being present&#8221; at the time, not having thought about interactions in that way before. Of course, in the subsequent years our personal technology has made all of us ever-less present with the people around us. Whether that means other people walking on the street, a cashier at the grocery, the business colleague we are sitting next to, or our spouse telling us about their day, we choose instead to &#8220;multi-task&#8221; and give our device and the people or bits and bytes on it our attention instead.</p>
<p>The beauty of being present is that it creates deeper and more meaningful moments. Similar to being mindful, being present is about increasing the quality of experience. Particularly when I was younger &#8211; less so now that I am perpetually multi-tasking &#8211; people commented on how much I made eye contact and engaged them fully and authentically. I was instinctively being present. Now, my instinct is to <em>try</em> but it takes a great deal of effort not to swing my eyes down and read that text, queue up my email, or even skim an article on the Internet. Why on Earth am I skimming some random article that I will forget about in half an hour, rather than committing myself to the people I am physically there with?</p>
<p>As I have written about before, much of our more destructive smartphone behaviour does come down to how we use the devices, not anything inherently wrong with the devices themselves. The challenge, however, is that the way the devices work naturally taps into our addictive tendencies and literally compels us to anti-social and unproductive behaviours. These realities of the hardware and software aren&#8217;t going to change anytime soon, leaving us to struggle against a gravity well of inattention of bifurcation.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t easy solutions. Ultimately I think the devices are more good than ill, and the turbocharged lives we lead are masses of potential. However, given that theoretical potential &#8211; imagining how we could be at our best in the world empowered by these devices &#8211; we aren&#8217;t anywhere near enjoying that promise. We move too quickly without being mindful, and we give our attention to the magic box in our hand as opposed to the living people in our environment. As humans are wont to do we&#8217;ve swung from one extreme &#8211; being alone with our thoughts and temporal reality &#8211; into the opposite. Now, we are overly focused on data from devices that is often mundane and far too often not resonant. Given that there are benefits to this extreme, and the chemical rewards our bodies permit us for following the habit, making change is non-trivial.</p>
<p>As for me, I am increasingly conscious of not being mindful, and not being present, and have a growing understanding for how important those things are. I&#8217;m going to really work on my willpower, to resist the urge to give myself to the magic box. Instead I&#8217;m going to try and implement Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s method into my own life. You will certainly still catch me sneaking a peek at that shiny little screen every now and again, but if I am successful this will occur increasingly less and finally, perhaps, cease altogether.</p>
