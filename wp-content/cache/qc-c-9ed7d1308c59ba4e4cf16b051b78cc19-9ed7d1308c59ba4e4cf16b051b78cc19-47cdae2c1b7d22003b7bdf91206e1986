				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve now been certified in four of the leading personality methodologies and have studied dozens more. One of the best are the Hogan Assessments, which use three different reports to cover your strengths, &#8220;derailers,&#8221; which are the areas you will likely manifest negative characteristics, and values. In its breadth covering a variety of important areas, the Hogan is one of the most useful tools on the market.</p>
<p>Of course, like seemingly every provider in the human understanding industry, their visualizations often muddy the waters they are attempting to navigate. A good example of that is with the &#8220;derailers&#8221; report, and what they call the &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;.</p>
<p>The formal name of the &#8220;derailers&#8221; is the HDS, or <a href="http://www.hoganassessments.com/assessments-hogan-development-survey" target="_blank">Hogan Development Survey</a>. It endeavours to identify &#8220;personality-based performance risks and derailers of interpersonal behaviour.&#8221; And indeed, the report itself is typically seen as forbidding by the people receiving it. The red bars have a decidedly negative connotation, and when you are getting your report and seeing a lot of red, like an exam at school when we were younger, it is most certainly not a good thing. Indeed, there is nothing in the report to refute this, with the larger red lines explicitly communicating higher risk. It seems very black-and-white (and red!): either you have a lot of red and are &#8220;good&#8221;, or not much red and are &#8220;bad&#8221;. If you are somewhere in the middle, you glance over the smaller red bars and focus on the larger red bars.</p>
<figure style="width: 400px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528" title="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dk_hogan.jpg" alt="Hogan 'Jewels of Personality'" width="400" /></a></p>
<figcaption>Can you guess where to find my &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221;?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shame of it is, this very specific report design does not reinforce the actual story the tool is telling. You see, red bars in the third level &#8211; the one next-to-highest and called moderate risk &#8211; are actually seen as a positive when evaluating candidates. Hogan calls them &#8220;the jewels of personality&#8221;. As my certification instructor taught, you want to see some of these in one&#8217;s report. They represent their personality, the parts of them that will be unique, interesting and have the potential to provide real value. Considering my own report, my excitability does contribute to the charisma I am able to turn on when the situation calls for it, and certainly my high imaginative is woven into many of the best skills that I have. It is accurate. And yes, even though my excitability in particular can be more of a derailer for me, it is as much or more of a strength than a weakness.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in this report reinforcing that. Yes, sure, your interpreter may explain this to you during the process. However I&#8217;ve witnessed how it can be &#8220;in one ear, and out the other&#8221;. For many people, all they are seeing are the red bars. And it is very black-and-white. Big red = bad, little red = good. The report is built that way. It is not just obtuse; it is unfortunate. The jewels of personality are left waiting to be found.</p>
<p>How better to design this tool? From a risk perspective, there are only three things that matter: no/low risk (green light), moderate risk (yellow light) and high risk (red light). For no/low risk, they really don&#8217;t even need to be mentioned. They are only marginally relevant to the person being assessed &#8211; if they are curious about the methodology there are other ways to learn it than valuable space on the core report &#8211; and their relevance to an organization is only in a specific context, such as a situation where a position could tolerate some types of risks but not others. It is the moderate and high risks that matter, the former something to keep in mind and the latter something to vet. But then there are the positives from this report, the jewels. Notably these don&#8217;t come out in any of the other Hogan reports, they just hide here. They should be brought out, focused on, perhaps even the first and primary part of this report. So, the primary focus are the moderate risks &#8211; called something more akin to their very clever and cute &#8220;jewels of personality&#8221; label &#8211; then the high risk should be the second focus and the no/low risk virtually no focus at all. Instead, this report deafens you with indeterminate bars of red.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t decided if this is an article about poor report construction in the psychological assessment industry or the fact many of our &#8220;riskiest&#8221; traits can also be those that make us most interesting and valuable. Both of those points are true and on clear display with the Hogan HDS and its conspicuously absent jewels of personality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we&#8217;ve looked at four core ways for analyzing Facio Behavioural results, let&#8217;s step back and consider how they work together:</p>
<p>Methodologically, Facio Behavioural identifies success and opportunity via alignment. That is, the better aligned†<strong>any</strong>†of the constituent data is, the healthier and more appropriate an individual&#8217;s behaviour is. Conversely, the more disparities there are, the more potential difficult nuances there may be with that person&#8217;s behaviour, and/or their ability to develop in different ways if that would be appropriate.</p>
<h2>High Self-Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Someone with a high degree of self-satisfaction who either exhibits an unrealistic self-perception, or has a large behavioural gap, may have difficulty acknowledging they should consider development, much less actively pursue it.</p>
<figure style="width: 412px; margin: 0px auto;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" title="High Self Satisfaction" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/high_self_satisfaction2.jpg" alt="High Self Satisfaction" width="412" height="252" /><br />
<figcaption>This person is happy with their work style, as are those they work with. But others perceive them much differently than they see themselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Realistic Self-Perception</h2>
<p>A person with realistic self-perception and a low degree of self-satisfaction may indicate someone very ready for development, or someone unable to develop in that area. Those are two very different things, and here you can bring in Gap Alignment to help ferret out which is more likely. Meanwhile, someone with a realistic self-perception who also has a large behavioural gap may not understand what the people around them or the context they are participating in really require from them. In that case they will first need some re-framing and new contextualization before development is likely to be successful.</p>
<figure style="width: 452px; margin: 0px auto;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Low Self Satisfaction" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/low_self_satisfaction2.jpg" alt="Low Self Satisfaction" width="412" height="252" /><br />
<figcaption>This person has a remarkably realistic self-perception, both for how they are and how they contextually should be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Small Behavioural Gap</h2>
<p>An individual with a small behavioural gap and low self-satisfaction may indicate the person is operating in ways that are uncomfortable for them. This realization can lead to significant personal development, but also the specter of potentially massive &#8211; and frightening &#8211; personal change. This can, in part, be validated by checking their Facio Preference results and seeing if the behaviour in question is indeed against preference.</p>
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" title="Perceiver" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/small-behaviour4.jpg" alt="Perceiver" width="600" height="229" /><br />
<figcaption>Considering the previous person, when considering they are an MBTI perceiver, developing a more relaxed work style will probably make them happier, as well as more effective.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A person with a small behavioural gap and an unrealistic self-perception will likely need some reinforcement of how they are seen by others being quite different than how they see themselves. While they should be pre-disposed to agreeing with the development path there may be some pre-work to ensure they have a proper frame for the situation.</p>
<p>Hopefully this overview of Facio Behavioural gives some insight into how powerful Facio can be, along with providing guidance and tools to unlocking it. While Facio is designed to allow the curious and honest explorers among us to work on self-development very aggressively, the real magic is often found when an experienced coach or counselor uses Facio with others. The combination of an objective perspective with training and experience in its use are truly powerful. Be well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing the series on analyzing Facio behavioural reports is the topic of Gap Alignment. This deals with a comparison of the difference between the self-actual and self-ideal with the others-actual and others-ideal. What you are looking for here is agreement or disagreement in order to add nuance to other aspects of Facio Behavioural.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_task_completion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-495" title="Facio Behaviours - Task Completion" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_task_completion-300x184.jpg" alt="Facio Behaviours - Task Completion" width="300" height="184" />Click to view</a><br />
<figcaption>Even though others&#8217; see me as being far less deadline driven than I see myself, we all agree: I would benefit from being more early starting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While your conclusions and analysis may different depending on the degrees of difference in each case, in general, if both the self and others are reporting that they would ideally like to change in the same direction, this is a nice way to validate with the person that the change they would like to see in themselves is also identified by others. This is valuable because it is absolute: regardless of any of the other behavioural indicators, there is agreement that the person should probably be more of one thing and less of another. That development path is clear. At the same time, when the individual would like to change in the opposite direction from what others are suggesting, it is a more nuanced analysis depending on the other system considerations. We will address these in our next and final installment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing the series on analyzing Facio behavioural reports, let&#8217;s now take a look at the question of Behavioural Gap. This is determined by comparing the others-actual and others-ideal results. It provides an aggregate perspective indicating how and how much people you work closely with think you should change you behaviour in order to be more effective in your role. This is perhaps the most immediately valuable way of using Facio Behavioural, providing a quick and straightforward indication of where development gaps might be.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_work_process.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-496" title="Facio Behaviours - Work Process" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_work_process-300x184.jpg" alt="Facio Behaviours - Work Process" width="300" height="184" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>Others see my approach to process as being highly structured. They suggest, given my role, I should be somewhat more fluid.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the others-actual and others-ideal have a difference of less than one, it indicates that other people think this way you are behaving is correct and appropriate given your role. When the others-actual and others-ideal is between one and two, it indicates that other people identify this behavioural aspect as a small-to-moderate gap. Most likely this indicates it is an area for which development would be beneficial to the role the person has at their organization, but is not a significant problem. However, when the others-actual and others-ideal is greater than two, this indicates a set of behaviours that your colleagues are clearly identifying as representing a gap between how you are functioning and how they believe you would be best able to fill your role. This is a definite development area to explore.</p>

<figcaption>I see myself as somewhat serious at work, and my colleagues agree.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This comparison helps you understand how realistically they see themselves compared to how others report their behaviour. Criteria where the self-actual and others-actual are identical or within one of one another indicates the individual has a likely realistic self-perception. When the self-actual and others-actual have a difference greater than one but less than three, they likely have a somewhat unrealistic understanding of how they actually are behaving. When the self-actual and others-actual have a difference of three or greater, the individual likely has a significantly unrealistic understanding of how they are actually behaving.</p>
<p>This is a relatively straightforward measure and one that, while it can be combined with other aspects of Facio Behavioural, tells quite a story on its own. Without exception, having a realistic self-perception is a good thing. Even in cases where you or others are dissatisfied with your actual behaviour, simply having an accurate picture of how you actually behave is a powerful and positive thing, reinforcing a basis for successful change, or reflecting a person with strong overall alignment.</p>

Facio Behavioural can be used either in conjunction with one&#8217;s Myers-Briggs style preferences &#8211; creating a powerful view into the intersection between preferences and behaviours &#8211; or as a stand-alone tool used with any other preferred methodologies.</p>
<p>In this five part series we will look at a variety of ways one can review reports from Facio Behavioural and use the results toward productive development for yourself, or others you are working with. The first aspect we will look at is Self-Satisfaction, which you determine from comparing one&#8217;s self-actual and self-ideal results.</p>

<figcaption>I would very much like to be more outgoing. Unfortunately extraverted behaviours make me uncomfortable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This comparison gives you an indication of how comfortable the person is in their own skin, insofar as each, specific professional aspect being reviewed is concerned. Criteria where the self-actual and self-ideal are the same or within one of each other indicates the person is largely satisfied with how they behave in this context. When the self-actual and self-ideal is two the person is somewhat dissatisfied with how they are behaving. Criteria where the self-actual and self-ideal are separated by three or greater is exhibiting significant dissatisfaction with how they are behaving.</p>
<p>Getting the most of Self-Satisfaction requires considering it with other aspects of Facio Behavioural, which will be covered in subsequent articles. The final article, Part 5, will look at how to consider these aspects together as a system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most difficult parts of understanding yourself is first being aware of, then being attuned to the relationships between, your behaviours, skills and preferences. While there are a variety of tools for measuring these aspects independently, we have not found any tools that integrate them in a useful way. That&#8217;s what our <a href="https://fac.io/report/4f75192b713be629f400001c/blended/spider/" target="_blank">blended report</a> is for. Still, while getting the data is a big part of finding your way to understanding, it really helps to have a basic idea of what you&#8217;re looking at. So let&#8217;s talk a little about these three aspects of the individual and how they work together:</p>
<p>Behaviours are what we actually do in the world. They are how we act, and interact. In some real way they are who we really are to other people: they only know what they are able to see.</p>
<p>Preferences are our inherent comfort levels. They reflect how we most prefer things to be, regardless of how they really are. Often times other people aren&#8217;t aware of our preferences; in fact sometimes even we aren&#8217;t aware of our preferences!</p>
<p>Skills are the abilities we have to function in different ways. We may or may not exercise them at a given moment or in a situation, but they provide a framework for what we are or are not able to do.</p>
<p>While each of those are interesting in and of themselves, deeper insight begins at their intersections. Consider:</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="left"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_pref_other_snapshot1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-582" title="Facio Behaviours &amp; Preferences" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_pref_other_snapshot1-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>While I allow my natural Introversion to come out with people I work closely with, I behave much more like a Thinker than the natural Feeler that I am.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Behaviours and Preferences. Considering these two together give you an indication a to how much a person is functioning within their natural comfort levels. While we homo sapiens are a tough and resilient lot that can successfully behave in ways that are not consistent with our natural preferences, it is generally not the healthiest and happiest way for us to be. Identifying misalignment between behaviours and preferences can help people gain awareness and understanding of aspects of their life that might be unknowingly contributing stress and discomfort. While valuable on an everyday basis it can be particularly informative as people are ready to change teams or jobs or even careers, helping them to more proactively define engagements and environments that align their personal comfort levels for what and how they are performing their responsibilities.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="right"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_skill_other_snapshot1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-584" title="Facio Behaviours &amp; Skills" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_skill_other_snapshot1-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>Despite my strongly Introverted behaviour, my solid skills around communication and interaction come through.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Behaviours and Skills. When viewing these two together you are able to get a sense not just of what the person is doing, but also some degree of how well they are doing it. People with very strong skills in a particular area &#8211; say, communication &#8211; will often have behaviours that are harder to pin down with specificity. Why? Their skill in that area allows them to communicate in the way most appropriate to the situation or people they need to interact with. On the other hand, when someone&#8217;s skill is very high and their behaviours are more extreme and specifically defined, they are likely very skilled at a particular method or style of communication but not necessarily adept at customizing for different situations. They just have their way, and do it extremely well.</p>

<figcaption>Strong skills working across Thinking and Feeling preferences, in this specific area, indicates an ability to shift against preference for the greater good.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Preferences and Skills. Analyzing these two together can provide valuable insight into the relationship between what someone is comfortable with and what they are good at. Often times, these things line up. We naturally gravitate toward things that make us comfortable, and in the process become better at those things through repetition. However there are also times where our preferences and skills look very different. This can be due to a number of factors, including our inherent strengths and weaknesses or gaining skills to better succeed or fit into our environments. Alignment between preferences and skills can provide insight into how people might react in certain situations. Major differences between preferences and skills may reflect a person who has worked hard to succeed in ways not naturally comfortable for them, but which seemed necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, bringing all three together provides even deeper opportunities for analysis and insight. In a later update I will use my own profile to share some examples of the power and potential of that. Have a great rest of the day!</p>
