			<p>Chances are you&#8217;re familiar with Abraham Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow posited that there is a sequence of prepotent needs, each of which must be satisfied before a higher level need emerges in the subject&#8217;s consciousness. Progressing from physiological, to safety, to belonging and love, to self-esteem, to self-actualization, Maslow&#8217;s theory generally rings true and &#8211; as a consequence &#8211; is a standard in beginning psychology.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you probably are not familiar with Clayton Alderfer. He advanced Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy, realizing both that the five categories were too finely grained and, more importantly, that Maslow&#8217;s notion of it being a serial continuum was inconsistent with how people actually lived. Alderfer truncated Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy into three ground of needs: Existence (physiological + safety), Relatedness (belonging and love), and Growth (self-esteem and self-actualization). This is known as ERG theory. Along with establishing that people were not completely &#8220;gated&#8221; within a lower level need until it had been moved beyond, Alderfer suggested that an inability to meet a higher level need would result in the person &#8220;doubling down&#8221; on trying to meet that need via pursuit of the lower level need. So, for example, being heartbroken (failed relatedness) might lead someone to indulge in food, drugs or sex in order to try and meet that unmet need in a different way (existence).</p>
<p>ERG theory is an improvement on Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy. The frame it provides is more fluid, and the core assumption &#8211; that we are not locked into a lower level need in a binary way until it has been moved beyond &#8211; far more consistent with both behavioural research and general common sense. </p>
<p>If you are interested in needs and motivations you will certainly come across Maslow; just make sure you also discover Alderfer&#8217;s ERG theory as &#8211; in our own research &#8211; it proves more theoretically valid as well as effective in application.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Companies that talk the whole transparency talk almost always draw the line on the historically most sensitive of topics: compensation. There is a notion that compensation is too sensitive, that letting everyone know what each other makes is just going to invite problems that you really don&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>There is some merit to this line of thinking. After all, the way we compensate people is hardly a meritocracy. The nature of business requires us to get most employees at as low a rate of compensation as we possibly can, in order to keep the business healthy. In the process, it is inevitable that some people are overpaid relative to their worth, while others are underpaid. This makes employees having transparency into compensation potentially frightening. More, given the relationship some people have between their relative pay and essential self-worth, the risk can go beyond destabilizing your organization to include impacting the self-esteem of one or more of your employees. It all sounds pretty scary, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a flip side to salary transparency. For one, it promotes accountability. If your organization is generally healthy, employees won&#8217;t let others skate by, and doubly so if they are overpaid relative to their contributions. The openness of information can help you get more out of underperformers in general, but particularly those who are overpaid. Now, it will also encourage top performers who are underpaid to possibly ask for more money. But ultimately, that&#8217;s OK. Paying good people what they are worth should never be a problem; the problem is overpaying people who aren&#8217;t worth it. Another benefit can be that it helps to hasten the departure of poor performers, but if you are managing well you shouldn&#8217;t need salary transparency to accomplish <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>The big picture upside to salary transparency is that it can, indeed, lead to a meritocratic workplace. This may not seem like a great idea to employers, who know that they get great deals on some of their employees, for whom their relative underpayment remains blissful ignorance. But that is the wrong way to look at it. The best companies are populated by motivated high performers. Knowing they are paid fairly is one of the characteristics of high performers. And for those poorly paid poor performers, well, they either need to be performing better or moving along. The net is transformative, as top performers thrive in an open environment and under performers are helped to change themselves or move into a situation where which they better align. It will surely be better for your business, and chances are it will ultimately be better for your people as well.</p>

<figcaption>Finding yourself</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Have you ever heard the axiom that waiting until you are 25 to get married gives you the greatest chance of happiness and success in that marriage? Like most axioms, it does not account for many other contextual things, not the least of which that each of us are unique. But 25 is a consistent number when it comes to identifying the right time to get married. From the politically conservative Focus on the Family organization (recommends 22-25) to the quantitatively driven Gallup research organization (recommending 25-27 as the best ages), to the cheeky and decidedly un-scientific Cosmo (25), that ol&#8217; 25 number keeps showing up. And, with good reason: 25 is a typical age where many of us have started getting much closer to finding ourselves. We&#8217;ve gone to college, likely left home, and have entered the workforce. We&#8217;ve experienced life as an adult and &#8211; in most cases &#8211; had one or more jobs, one or more lovers and one or more domiciles of our own. We&#8217;ve experimented with the world a bit and figured out, on our own two feet, some degree of what works for us, what does not, and how we fit into the whole thing. This process, which gives us clarity and stability around who we are, strongly positions us to choose a good partner and forge a relationship that is worthwhile. Often without intending to do so, we&#8217;ve really started understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>This notion of &#8220;finding yourself&#8221; is every bit as important in our careers. The best jobs are those where there is alignment between the company, the people around you, the roles the job will require of you, and what you enjoy and succeed at doing. The less aligned any of these things are, the more likely we will be unhappy, ineffective, and/or not stay very long &#8211; a classic lose-lose scenario.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to find myself professionally. At first, I did not take my professional life at all seriously, sleepwalking thru my BA and MA before financial pressures forced me to leave the academic path and start making more money. I am naturally energetic and eager-to-please, so for a time whenever an opportunity that seemed interesting came up I was excited to just jump right in. The good news, during this period, is I learned a lot. The bad news is I kept picking things that were not good fits, leading to the thrill of learning and success quickly turning to the frustration of not enjoying what I was doing. For me, it was also complicated by ego and wanting to be &#8220;the best&#8221; in some completely generic and generally unfocused way. These were necessary steps toward my gaining real understanding.</p>
<p>After repeating this pattern with employers it only continued when I started out as an entrepreneur. I just sort of continued on the paths that were already before me, striving forward without really stepping back and evaluating what I wanted to and really should be doing. In my case, I was actually in my late 30&#8242;s before I had a clear picture of not just what I was or was not good at, but what I really enjoyed and did not enjoy doing. That clarity &#8211; fairly recent, still &#8211; has enabled me to evolve toward a professional life that gets the most out of me while proving fulfilling in personal and professional ways. It is a path that now allows contentment and happiness to join with the previous success and effectiveness I&#8217;ve long enjoyed. It is a far better place for someone to be.</p>
<p>My situation is just one example, but finding ourselves professionally allows us to feel the most rewarded and have our overall life positively impacted by what we do even while contributing more and better for the organizations that employ us.</p>

<figcaption>Context and development</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This week I read an article talking about how professional basketballer players in the National Basketball League tend to develop relative to the context that they are placed in. Good, young players who are drafted by or traded to top teams that are already successful, having coaching stability, and have clearly established roles and performers in place are more likely to reach their potential. Former coach Jeff Van Gundy credits this sort of development to the player &#8220;know(ing) who he is, and play(ing) to his role.&#8221; This theory goes on to suggest that while talented young players blossom in these conditions, the same players become mediocre when playing for poor teams because, with too much expected of them as &#8220;saviors&#8221; of a bleak situation, they struggle to figure out who they are, and they don&#8217;t have a clear, realistic role.</p>
<p>Thee dynamics are particularly pronounced in professional basketball, where a franchise has just 12 players working for them, making a combined ~$58,000,000 &#8211; or almost $5,000,000 each on average. On the other hand IBM reports having 434,246 employees nationwide, meaning that no matter how stringent and ideal their top-down structures might be the provision of ideal employee environments will often be determined at at the level of a sub-organization or even an individual team. In business we do not enjoy the intense focus on a handful of people that allows the best organizations to consistently develop better performers.</p>
<p>The lesson is that doing things the right way does not just help you perform better in the short-term, it creates an environment of excellence that helps you perform better later. New employees are far more likely to find their place and carve out a specific role suitable to their abilities in a stable and high-functioning organization. Yes, as always, this won&#8217;t prove true for everyone. Superstars often benefit from being &#8220;dropped into the deep end&#8221; and being given more room and freedom to develop as opposed to being constrained by a system. Remember: the Chicago Bulls were abysmal before Michael Jordan came to town, not winning more than 45 games in any season from 1975-1984. He thrived by stepping into the mess. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, while mediocre performers might become better versions of themselves in healthy organizations, they also aren&#8217;t likely to be transformed into high performers just by virtue of the context. The limitations that make them less capable &#8211; lacking in skills, motivation or just generally not embracing and putting themselves into their careers &#8211; are more difficult to change.</p>
<p>Regardless, the bottom line is that the best way to get the most out of the majority of new hires you will make is having already implemented the bedrock of a high-performing culture: stability that crosses all of vision and strategy, management and team composition, with appropriate roles and processes that work well and are adaptable to make the most of the unique gifts and offerings of the specific people.</p>

			<p>It is common for small businesses to say &#8220;We&#8217;re really more like a family.&#8221; While well intentioned, the analogy is not particularly flattering. Even relatively happy families have complicated interpersonal conflict, are emotionally charged, and get caught up in the needs of the individuals over the good of the group. To the contrary, high-performing businesses require low friction relationships, objectivity without being excessively personal, and a focus on shared goals instead of individual gratification. Sure, being friendly and caring about each other is an important aspect of high-functioning teams and strong cultures. Certainly not at a level that resembles that of a family, however. In fact, it is not uncommon for small companies to express the dysfunctions often on display in families, because their small size and static power relationships lend themselves to developing similar characteristics. The analogy has merit, it just isn&#8217;t the personality companies should be going for.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been told to &#8220;keep it professional,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing personal,&#8221; or some other platitude related to maintaining objectivity and viewing our professionals behaviours as being distinctly removed from our personal selves. I remember a line in a movie where the actor said something like, &#8220;When someone tells you it&#8217;s not personal, that&#8217;s when you know it is very personal.&#8221; While a catchy line, it&#8217;s not particularly true. Yes, for the person being adversely impacted by whatever is happening, if they do not maintain an appropriate professional detachment, the disappointment or upset becomes a personal feeling. That is an error of framing by that individual. In fact, we need to be diligent to remember that it isn&#8217;t, or at least shouldn&#8217;t be, personal. Great businesses come from straddling the right side of that delicate line.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s easy. I remember more than one time when something that was happening in my professional life felt personal, I treated as personal, and in some cases reacted in inappropriate emotional ways. It took time and experience to adjust my expectations and reactions. More than part of my professional development, it was an aspect of my personal development. Thinking back on my career, I can&#8217;t think of any moment when my own or a colleague&#8217;s bring the personal into a distinctly professional situation was for the better.</p>
<p>So make friends at work. Be yourself as much as is appropriate in the specific professional context you inhabit. Imbue your participation with that goodness. In addition, keep it professional. Remember that your employer is ultimately in business to make good business decisions, not necessarily give you the raise or promotion or ongoing employment you want or think you deserve. Your boss might need to let you go. She might still be your friend; it&#8217;s nothing personal. The challenge for you is to manage to keep it professional.</p>
