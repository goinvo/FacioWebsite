			<p>Personality (n.) -Â The combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual&#8217;s distinctive character.</p>
<p>It seems pretty simple. But dictionary definitions aside, our notions of personality are either incomplete, or dictated by the conceptual models provided by different people or organizations. Incomplete, because we equate characteristic such as extraversion as being personality. They may be a part of it, but they surely are not all of it. That is easy enough to understand.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="The Binds of Personality Typing" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The-Binds-of-Personality-Typing.png" alt="The Binds of Personality Typing" /><br />
<figcaption>The Binds of Personality Typing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The relationship between personality and conceptual models is a fair bit more difficult to untangle. These models &#8211; things like the four-letter personality type designed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers and the DISC method of William Marston &#8211; are helpful aids in providing us with understanding. One of the wonderful benefits of these tools is providing structure that lead to understanding. I warmly remember being first exposed to such methods in my mid-20&#8242;s via the work of David Keirsey. Whereas, up to that point, much of my understanding of others was that they were &#8220;nice&#8221; or &#8220;aggressive&#8221; or &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;quiet&#8221;, suddenly I had a more sophisticated vocabulary. More than that, I had a framework within which I fit, where I could &#8220;see&#8221; myself and &#8211; in resonating with the things that I read &#8211; feel empowered. As time went on and I learned more it also helped me to understand others.</p>
<p>These are lovely things, all. But there are problems. None of these frameworks agree with each other. There is truth to be gleaned from each of them, but which is &#8220;right&#8221;? If one is ultimately correct in any discernable way we will likely have a hard time figuring out which one, as the creators or licensees of each advocate their own to further personal gain. Unfortunately, research universities largely stay away from applied personality frameworks which is indeed a shame, as some greater level of objectivity and rigour may be offered by those organizations.</p>
<p>Yet, discerning truth is the least of it. A larger issue is the closing down of how we look at and interpret the world. As empowering as these frameworks initially are, and as helpful as they can prove to be, they also lock our thinking into them. We see the world as ENTP&#8217;s, or as DC&#8217;s, or as 2-2-1-1&#8242;s. Practitioners as well as normal individuals associate themselves with one method or another and use that as their lens to understand personality. While each of those conceptions are interesting and useful, they are also limiting. None offers a complete picture, and they teach us to translate our understanding of others into their idiosyncratic form. It is not a completely bad thing, there are many good things about the tools. But they naturally keep us from thinking beyond their bounds both because of the benefits they provide, and the bounds themselves.</p>
<p>So by all means, learn about personality models. Learn from the smart work that has been done, discover yourself, develop tools to understand others. But don&#8217;t let that be the only language you speak in and think about this vitally important thing, personality. Stay open-minded. Learn about other methods. Nuance both your understanding and interpretation. It is the next step to greater enlightenment in the complicated world of human understanding.</p>

<p>High-achieving employees who combine a strong work ethic and good attention to detail tend to be hands-on managers. Typical, positive traits of good hands-on managers is their &#8220;showing&#8221; excellence in action to their employees, keeping their eye on assignments and development plans, and pushing them to success. One of the down sides of this management style &#8211; that sometimes seems like a strength &#8211; is intervening to ensure their employees don&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p>Yes, preventing a failure of some sort in the moment is good for the system and assignment &#8211; in the moment. The challenge is, people need to be trusted and empowered to see something through to completion. Whether they succeed or fail, the process of going to the end and the learnings that they take from that are invaluable. Sure, they are also learning when watching someone more seasoned do it for them. But the real learning requires both watching and doing. In the early going, the doing is going to be wrong.</p>
<p>I know, I know: for people who pursue and achieve excellence it can be hard to watch that failing happen. But it is just part of the process. In the days of master craftsmen, it was understood that there would be some waste: of time, of materials. It was literally built into the expectations of the relationship with that apprentice. Just watching, no matter for how long, doesn&#8217;t get you all the way there. Those lessons so ingrained into generations of craftspeople have been lost as we all naturally careen through the workplace.</p>
<p>The reality is, failing is important. For young professionals, for children, for all of us who are doing new things &#8211; part of evolving beyond ignorance and clumsiness is feeling what it is like to fall down. When we see others who are struggling to figure something out, it might be hard not to help. And certainly, sometimes helping is good and important. But sometimes, every now and then, we also need to let them fail.</p>

			<p>My friend Bo used to encourage me to give grace, to myself and to others. It is great advice that I was reminded of when <a href="http://www.thestar.com/life/2013/04/17/dove_video_ad_shows_women_are_more_beautiful_than_they_think.html" target="_blank">watching this video</a>.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Giving grace" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Grace.png" alt="Giving grace" /></p>
<figcaption>We are terribly hard on ourselves. We needn&#8217;t be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Leaving my skepticism on the shelf &#8211; the creator of the video, Dove, is part of an industry that fosters the same insecurities they are raising awareness of &#8211; the video illustrates how hard we are on ourselves. Rather than giving ourselves grace &#8211; focusing on the things we like, de-emphasizing or at least proportionally acknowledging the things we don&#8217;t &#8211; most of us in the western first world are hard on ourselves. It&#8217;s one of the byproducts of the values underlying success in the free market. We have learned to obsess and feel shame about our failings while overlooking all of the lovely things that each and every one of us have to offer.</p>
<p>There is very little to gain by flogging ourselves for being something other than who we are. While behaviours unhealthy to ourselves and others should be acknowledged and mitigated, otherwise we are best-served by just accepting who we are and leveraging our positives. It will provide us with uniformly improved happiness and well-being, while positioning us in a more confident and positive light with those we love, live and work with. At the core, it is about giving ourselves grace.</p>
<p>But we, ourselves, are only part of the equation. One of the mistakes I still frequently make is being disappointed in people who don&#8217;t do things how I would do them. Let me give you an example. On Twitter, when people converse with me, 99% of the time I&#8217;m going to respond and acknowledge them. I don&#8217;t care if I follow them or not, don&#8217;t care who or what they are. If they take the time to genuinely engage me in some way I want to show them the respect and appreciation of acknowledgement. Well, recently I sent a message to someone I don&#8217;t know, complimenting them and trying in a very small way to engage. Days passed; they did not respond. It materially changed the way I felt toward them. I was even embarrassed to not be responded to and deleted my original tweet!</p>
<p>What a shame. I have no way of knowing why that person didn&#8217;t respond to me. The odds that it was for some reason that I would actually find hurtful &#8211; they think I&#8217;m not worthy of the time &#8211; are quite low. There are dozens of other, very benign, reasons they didn&#8217;t acknowledge me. Yet, I put my own framing on the situation and chose to have negative feelings: about them, about the situation, and about myself. Isn&#8217;t it ridiculous? Why do we assume the worst? Why do we not give others the grace to be themselves?</p>
<p>As I get older, I am less apt to shenanigans such as that example. But it is hard to just naturally and easily give others grace. It is not how we are generally taught, and we are making ourselves vulnerable by leaning into that possible weakness or embarrassment. In most cases, though, that vulnerability is unlikely to turn into something actually hurtful. Instead, by foregoing our fear, we have less negative energy, more self-assuredness, and are treating ourselves and others better. It&#8217;s a no brainer, really, but often easier said than done. When in doubt, give yourself (or them) grace!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week we looked at the three big questions you should be asking yourself in order to make the best choices about your career. This week we will talk about when and why you should prioritize each of them.</p>
<p>While, ideally, all three of these things would be satisfied by the position we are currently in, this degree of alignment is unfortunately uncommon in the world today. So you should focus on making sure that two of them are being met, if at all possible. Here are the three combinations, and situations compatible with each:</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing?Â What do I want from my job?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This combination removes the ambition aspect. If you are not future-focused on your professional life, or not really into &#8220;a career&#8221;, you should focus on these two things. Performing tasks every day that you enjoy or, at least, don&#8217;t mind makes &#8220;work&#8221; something more than a four-letter word. It is worth holding out for this. Then, make sure your needs are being met by your employer. We all work for different reasons. For some of us, it is all about the Benjamins. For others, it is about working with people we like and being treated with respect. Actually, it is never just one thing. But figure out what the most important things are for you and get them.</p>
<p>The bottom line with this combination is to spend your day doing things you like, and make sure you are getting the rewards and treatment you need from your employer.</p>
<p>2. What do I want to be doing?Â Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2_2.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, you are least concerned with compensation, recognition and environmental aspects, focused on the things your job will have you do, and how it can position you for the future. In this case, you have a clear vision of where you want to go in the long run, and you are very focused on getting the experience and skills necessary to ascend to that point. While title is often important in these cases as well, you are largely foregoing a focus on compensation or ego needs in exchange for taking something you think is just what you need to advance.</p>
<p>This is a good combination for young professionals, or for people reinventing themselves mid-career, or people with highly specific professional goals. This is how interns or apprentices should be thinking, aligning their day-to-day with the future in front of them.</p>
<p>3. What do I want from my job?Â Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Triangulating your career, Part 2" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triangulating2_3.jpg" alt="Triangulating your career, Part 2" /><br />
<figcaption>Triangulating your career, Part 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is the most future-focused configuration, as you de-prioritize the importance of what your job asks you to do and just make sure it has you on the proper long-term career path. Salary is often particularly important to this group as growing in one&#8217;s career is usually accompanied by ratcheting up your standard of living. In other cases, incentives such as the right title to be leveraged in the future, or working with or for famous or accomplished individuals and companies are big factors in making a decision. After all, if your job is to get Stephen Spielberg&#8217;s coffee, but if you&#8217;re able to negotiate a title like &#8220;Assistant Producer&#8221; in the deal, you&#8217;ve now worked on a movie with Stephen Spielberg. Needless to say there are worse things for one&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>This is the terrain of the ambitious or just people very committed to &#8220;getting ahead&#8221; from where they are now. By focusing on that future, and your personal needs in the process, you can create the best chance to realize success.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t take this article to mean I don&#8217;t think you should try and have it all. Being mindful about these three aspects is the first step to achieving the proverbial &#8220;dream job&#8221;. However, from a practical perspective, unless your financial situation gives you no other choice, always ensure you are meeting at least two of these needs. It will help work to be a healthier part of your life, contribute to greater overall well-being, and put you in control of the impact your work has upon your life.</p>

<figcaption>Actively thinking about what you are looking for professionally will help your life better align with your needs and desires.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When thinking about your career, there are three primary tensions that must be reconciled to crate satisfaction for yourself professionally:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What do I want to be doing?</p>
<p>I remember at the start of my career, I didn&#8217;t really care what I was doing. I just wanted to get paid! As I got more experience, it became clear what I did &#8211; or, more frequently &#8211; did not want to do. For example, I learned that did not want to be a line cook. Or fill, pack and ship boxes. Or be a legal assistant. Or be a bartender. On the other hand, I kind of liked being a ghost writer. And I REALLY loved betting on horses at the track to make money, but my conservative middle class upbringing insured that I never seriously entertained spending my professional life doing that!</p>
<p>Today, as an almost-fortysomething, I have a very clear idea of what I want to be doing and not doing. Writing, research, creative direction, executive leadership: yes. Sales, service, administration: no. Having a crisp understanding of what I do and do not want to do empowers me to make better decisions about jobs I want to take &#8211; or not.</p>
<p>2. What do I want from my job?</p>
<p>Money, title, responsibilities, benefits, perks, recognition, flex time, autonomy&#8230;the many things that aren&#8217;t literally what we do but critically frame our satisfaction in doing it. We learn that money and title are the big ones to negotiate for yet &#8211; while they are important &#8211; it is the other things that often cause us to leave or love what we are doing. As with the first point, these are very personal. For example, I am now accustomed to being an entrepreneur. For the last decade I&#8217;ve worked for myself. While I can see myself again working for someone else, now I would need some set of responsibilities, some domain over which I am the final decision maker. That&#8217;s vital to me. And far more than money or title, having that is the &#8220;dealbreaker&#8221;. It took me a long time to know that about myself. When I was younger, what I wanted out of the job was far less apparent to me and manifested in money or title. I still didn&#8217;t know myself, and that opacity also obfuscated my ability to figure out what I really wanted out of what I was doing.</p>
<p>3. Where do I want my career to take me?</p>
<p>This can also be called the &#8220;ambition factor&#8221;: for those who want to be a corporate CEO, it is huge. For those who like doing illustration and don&#8217;t want to do anything else, it can be largely irrelevant. It is about looking into the future and having an idea of where you hope to later be. This is another one that changes as we grow. In my case, when I first started my career, I had no sense of a specific place I wanted my career to end up at. Once I started getting on a track, however, I got the very specific notion of running my own company. This eventually transferred to the company itself, and having ideas about what I wanted that company to be. Finally, now that I&#8217;ve &#8220;made it&#8221;, this is a very small consideration for me. I don&#8217;t have any ego needs left here. And, I&#8217;ve reached a level and stature in my career where I should be able to &#8220;get a job&#8221; that pays a lot at any point. I don&#8217;t need to keep rising to create financial protection for myself and my family. Barring a total collapse of the economy and society, I&#8217;ve done all I need to do from the standpoint of ambition.</p>
<p>Next week we will take these three factors and talk about how you can balance them in making good decisions for yourself in your own career.</p>
