				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The differences between &#8220;morning people&#8221; and &#8220;night people&#8221; are significant, as is the way they intersect with one another and their employer.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Morning and Night" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Morning-Night_300.jpg" alt="Morning Night" /></p>
<figcaption>The time of day you are at your best may suggest more about you than you realize.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Morning people tend to be more optimistic, physically energetic and proactive. Night people tend to be more intelligent, creative and have a better sense of humour. As always, these generalities are not true for all members of the group. While each of these types have clear advantages, the biggest impact of any of these things is the fact that morning people&#8217;s natural rhythms are aligned with the 9-5 professional world, while night people&#8217;s are not. Research has shown that, as a direct result of these issues of chronotype, morning people do better in school, have access to better institutes of higher learning, get better jobs, and enjoy more lucrative career arcs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty massive impact on our life outcomes! Now, step back and consider it from a societal perspective: if night people are generally more intelligent, but morning people are getting the better access to superior learning and work opportunities, we are by definition using our available resources inefficiently. Thanks to what is essentially thousands of years of inertia around structuring our societies around the daylight &#8211; after all, the electric light is less than 150 years old as an established technology &#8211; our societal systems support and reward morning people while punishing night people. We have not shifted the rhythm of systems and organizations to match how people live, instead naturally preserving the way it has always been done.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions. Not surprisingly, they are exceptions created by the marketplace. Once it became possible to have factory workers work day and night, shifts were added so the workers would go day and night. This was done because the benefits were obvious, and quantifiable: enabling people to produce at all hours of the day increases profits for the employer. These industries at this point have reached an even more sophisticated level of maturity, no longer just going flat-out at all times but crafting schedules that reflect when their people are most productive. All of this is easy, because the benefits are transparent.</p>
<p>While it is clumsy to claim that having the smarter people get the better opportunities would lead to better organizational success and profits &#8211; who knows, perhaps optimism is more important than intelligence? &#8211; it is immediately clear that having the preponderance of societal organizations catering to morning people at the expense of night people is illogical. Technology has rendered such coarse methods obsolete. If our systems didn&#8217;t try to jam night people into the rhythms of the morning people, what potential would that unlock? How would it improve their lives? How would they contribute more and better? Even though these are not easily quantifiable, our society and its citizens would clearly benefit from more flexible systems that work for both the people of the morning, and the people of the night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m glad to be alive in this day and age. My skills are generally intellectual and persuasive in nature, and they lend themselves to a knowledge economy and democratic openness. The way &#8220;the system&#8221; is built aligns pretty well with who I am. In secondary school I was identified as someone talented and a high achiever. My skills were celebrated and I received considerable validation from teachers and other administrators.</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Getting a better start" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ChannelEarly.jpg" alt="Channel Early" /></p>
<figcaption>Our education system is a hammer that thinks everyone one of us is a nail. Surely, we are not.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the other hand were the lower performing students. Saddled with poor grades and branded with negative connotations, these students were taking generally the same program of study I was, yet it was clear that they were unlikely to be participants in the knowledge economy. Now, 20 years removed from high school, some of these specific peers have settled into jobs as auto mechanics, carpenters and factory workers. 1,000 years ago they would have become apprentices in a trade at a young age and received deep cultural respect; today, they were forced through an educational system of limited value to them. In the process they were made to feel diminished and unsuccessful. They were not the problem; the problem was a system that failed to account for who they uniquely are.</p>
<p>While the difference between someone who is very intellectual and someone who is very physical in their gifts is an easy example, the greater nuance lies in those with more similarities. Take five random children and someday they will grow into specific professions. Let&#8217;s for the sake of a concrete example say that they develop into a philosopher, a movie director, a software engineer, a social worker and an administrator. At what point in their lives did they start &#8220;on the track&#8221; that led them to those outcomes? Maybe the director figured it out in junior high school, because she idolized Martin Scorsese. But the education system surely did little to support her. It clicked for the philosopher as a high school senior, when they took a course on philosophy. Most high schools don&#8217;t offer this, but he got lucky. The social worker wanted to be a nurse but realized in nursing school, which can be very expensive, it was not the right fit and started over in social work. The software engineer started taking physics in university, pretty quickly realized the career potential of software engineering, and simply changed her major. Too bad she wasn&#8217;t thinking of that as a possible career much younger, as she could have been writing code for a decade already. The administrator always vaguely knew that he wanted to &#8220;go into business&#8221; and followed the channel thru undergraduate and then an MBA. It turns out his skills really aren&#8217;t tuned for executive leadership and the MBA was thus largely a waste of money. But, he ended up approximately where he always thought he would be.</p>
<p>There are many other examples we could choose. But what is notable here is, even in the best case, how late people really figured out what they were going to do, or the fact they were not supported academically in their interests until much later. Now, imagine how much different their lives would have been if:</p>
<p>- The philosopher has been identified as a big idea person at a young age, exposed to philosophy (among other intellectual topics) before high school and takes courses more germane to that future throughout those years</p>
<p>- The movie director were given a consistent thread of courses on topics like art direction, cinematography, writing and acting, alongside some more general courses</p>
<p>- The software engineer&#8217;s aptitude for math and science were identified early, and they were exposed to those type of careers at a young age. They would take courses exposing them to the applied skills and activities of those professions &#8211; at an obviously rudimentary level &#8211; and they may have found software engineering much, much earlier</p>
<p>- The social worker&#8217;s desire to help others and work in the broad medical field were compared with their skills and preferences, rooting out that they may be best actualized by more of a counseling, person-to-person relationship instead of the hands-on medical aspects of nursing. Beyond just preparatory classes they would have avoided wasting money in nursing school</p>
<p>- The administrator could have developed a far more nuanced understanding for &#8220;being in business&#8221; as a youngster, and helped to explore different roles in the context of their skills. They would have entered university with a pretty clear vision of what business as a complicated, structural context looks like and the parts they would best fit into. They either may have enjoyed a much higher trajectory in their career as a result and made the most of their MBA program, or saved the $100,000 investment altogether</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not used to thinking about channeling our young people like this. But what they would be learning would be no less age-appropriate than the general subjects they are exposed to in school today. The difference is that, instead of blindly tossing everyone into the same generic educational path we identify their diversity of preferences, skills and desires and cultivate those to give them the best possible foundation for who they are likely to become. It is a crucial aspect to getting a better start, and you can be sure the number of people who end up on the &#8220;wrong track&#8221; out of such methods will be orders of magnitude less than the poor people currently marooned and misdirected in our current, antiquated systems.</p>

<p>How old were you when you had a really crisp understanding of who you are? I was 25. I stumbled upon David Keirsey&#8217;s work, and it revealed to me &#8211; for the first time in my life &#8211; that there are structured ways of looking at and thinking about ourselves and each other. I&#8217;ve spent the next 15 years learning first about myself, then about others, and finally about the methods and frameworks in general. How old were you when you first started learning about human understanding? Have you ever really learned about it?</p>
<figure class="alignleft" style="width: 300px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-488" title="Begin Early" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BeginEarly.jpg" alt="Math" /></p>
<figcaption>Is learning about these things really more important than deeply understanding ourselves and one another?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is surreal that physics, calculus, European history and &#8220;Brit Lit&#8221; are core parts of our secondary school curriculum yet core aspects of the self like introversion and extraversion, or the idea of having a realistic understanding of how others see you are arcane knowledge reserved for adults who are lucky or curious enough to stumble into them. We learn very clearly what makes an apple fall to the ground but have a clumsy understanding of who we are and how we fit into the world.</p>
<p>Helping children understand who they are, and giving them language and frameworks for understanding different types of people and situations, is the most valuable knowledge we can give them. While the learnings we make in physics will benefit a miniscule percentage of our citizens, human understanding will benefit each and every one of us. While this series of articles is focused on people orienting themselves professionally &#8211; from secondary school through higher education and then onto a career &#8211; these skills also benefit us in our personal lives. And there is really no excuse not to: if we are capable of learning physics and calculus we are surely capable of some degree of inculcation in human understanding.</p>
<p>It is more than just about general education of concepts, of course. From a young age, we need to beging collecting data and documenting aspects of our development. Once there is data from a lot of people and over time, we can determine what choices people made and how successful those choices were, from a standpoint of wealth, happiness and security &#8211; among other factors. From this we will have a tapestry by which to inform our perspective of how we can best be in the world. By starting at a young age, instead of blindly thrashing until we are adults, we can have some real grounding in who and how we are from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Surely, knowing who we are is more important than memorizing the wives of Henry VIII and how each of them died.</p>

<figcaption>Not only are each of us very different, so are the various things we can end up doing in our lives.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Did you know that 80% of college students change their majors? And the average college student changes their major three times? While perhaps dismissed as &#8220;just part of the process&#8221;, it speaks to a process that is badly broken. I mean, think about it: when we are in high school we are already being driven to &#8220;choose&#8221;. That&#8217;s because the process of getting into university requires a vision and commitment when you are still just a relative child. It makes no sense, and that fooolishness plays out with people thrashing through their 18-22 years, many unable to get comfortable and making the realization that the path they picked isn&#8217;t the right one for them.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem starts even earlier than that. Our degree of self-understanding as children and young adults is generally woeful. We simply are not in touch with who we are, much less who those around us are, which leads toward us muddling through our lives. A good teacher will inspire us and take us in a direction that we are not necessarily compatible with. An enthusiastic parent will make their interests ours without consideration of what would best fit each of us. An aptitude for a particular subject is translated into something tantamount to one&#8217;s life calling &#8211; when it might not be that at all.</p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks we will look at three different ways that a re-thinking of how we treat children and young adults can lead those future citizens into lives that better resonate with their essential selves. For most of us, nothing in life is quite so wonderful as &#8220;fitting in&#8221;, whether that be with an academic program, a career, our circle of friends, or the person we choose to spend our lives with. Finding fit requires knowing ourselves. We&#8217;re going to talk about how we can help people from a much earlier age get a sense of who they are and how and where they fit.</p>

<figcaption>We may not get along, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the other person is broken.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of us assign moral failing to others who are different than us. The networker who flits their way around the social event is “superficial”. The quiet person who stays in the corner and doesn’t have much to say is “boring”. The loud person performing for a group not sensitive to the noise and space needs of people around them is “obnoxious”. The intellectual who has a critical word for seemingly everything is “arrogant”.</p>
<p>Diminishing others with such language and framing is a huge mistake that we almost universally make. We attribute to their <em>character</em> what are actually facets of their <em>inherent personality</em>. Sure, it is much easier to translate the discomfort they make us feel into some failing on their part. However, most of the time, it is not a failing by either party and instead an incompatibility between them. Indeed, each of us know other people who we “can’t stand”, yet sure enough they have friends, family, people who like and trust them. The problem isn’t them, it is the intersection between who we are, and who they are.</p>
<p>This stretches beyond personality as well. Sometimes the issue is one of territory. There can only be one CEO, so people who otherwise would get along begin seeing one another negatively because their ambitions are contradictory. Other times the issue is one of time: I am in a hurry and the other person is not. This creates conflict as we try to accomplish different things in different ways. Most of the time, in all of these cases, we turn that friction between us into a judgement of the other person. We objectify and diminish them, rather than saving blame and viewing the situation more objectively. After all, when someone blocks us or makes us feel uncomfortable, it is easier and more cathartic to say “What an a-hole!” instead of, “Ah, he’s just an extraverted intuitive.”</p>
<p>To improve your mental health and capacity for bringing goodness to the world, be aware of these judgement that you make as you go thru life. Turn the aspersions toward the other person into a recognition that you just aren’t lining up with each other. That might make you uncomfortable, but it surely does not make them bad.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things to grumble about thanks to the cultural changes smartphones are imposing on our society. People dangerously texting and driving; people not paying attention to conversations as they mechanically check their device instead; people ignoring what superficially seems their primary activity while giving attention to something less important because it comes thru their device. These are all negative byproducts of the wonderful, magical technology that gives us seemingly the entire world with the swipe of a finger or utterance of a question.</p>
<p>Beyond these more obvious negatives, the prevalence of our &#8220;always-on&#8221; culture has some more fundamentally negative impacts that, while subtle, promise to truly harm us over the long term. In the aggregate, we are less mindful and less present than we used to be. While each of these is a unique and important consideration, they also nicely overlap.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin felt mindfulness was among the most important virtues an active, thinking citizen can employ. The questions he began and ended his day with:</p>
<p>Morning: What good shall I do this day?</p>
<p>Evening: What good I have done to-day?</p>
<p>What an interesting and &#8211; at least for me and many people who I know engaged at the vanguard of technology and knowledge work &#8211; novel concept. Speaking now only for myself, I careen from one thing into the next, with little-to-no preparation or framing. My day is a cascade of crashing-into-the-next-thing. While I certainly get a lot done, some great degree of that can be ultimately considered simple churn. The quantity is significant, the <em>superficial</em> quality, as well. But thinking about Franklin&#8217;s approach to his day, I&#8217;m struck by how very much is lost.</p>
<p>While now an anachronism, there was a time where &#8211; before a pre-arranged meeting &#8211; you would reach out and &#8220;touch&#8221; the person again, both to confirm the arrangement but also reinforce the purpose. Then, after the meeting, you would think back on the interaction, apply it to a broader context, and follow up in thoughtful ways, likely sending a hand-written note. My friend Dave uses an elaborate checklist system to try and cultivate just these behaviours today.</p>
<p>More than social niceties or simple ritual, these intentional acts enable you to macerate in the person, the interaction and the shared purpose. This has two benefits. First, it makes the most out of the activity. One of my favourite movie lines is from &#8220;The Hunt for Red October&#8221;, when a wry sailor comments that they are moving so fast their sonar wouldn&#8217;t even be able to hear his daughter&#8217;s &#8211; presumably ear-splittingly loud &#8211; stereo. His concern was that they were moving so fast they were subverting the very purpose of their mission: to listen.</p>
<p>The speed with which we consume and move beyond experiences at best threatens to lessen the benefit and appreciation of those experiences, and at worst puts the purpose of the experience at risk altogether. The benefits &#8211; doing more &#8211; is offset by the reality of getting less from each. While I don&#8217;t have some magic calculus with which to precisely evaluate where the point of diminishing returns lies, I have increasingly come to believe that in most cases, slowing down and employing a more thoughtful and systematic approach will more likely provide the greater benefit for ourselves, for the other participants, and for the shared objectives overall.</p>
<p>All of this goes hand-in-hand with being present. Almost 10 years ago now, my friend Brett told me that his best professional skill was being present (Brett is a therapist). I was struck by the notion of &#8220;being present&#8221; at the time, not having thought about interactions in that way before. Of course, in the subsequent years our personal technology has made all of us ever-less present with the people around us. Whether that means other people walking on the street, a cashier at the grocery, the business colleague we are sitting next to, or our spouse telling us about their day, we choose instead to &#8220;multi-task&#8221; and give our device and the people or bits and bytes on it our attention instead.</p>
<p>The beauty of being present is that it creates deeper and more meaningful moments. Similar to being mindful, being present is about increasing the quality of experience. Particularly when I was younger &#8211; less so now that I am perpetually multi-tasking &#8211; people commented on how much I made eye contact and engaged them fully and authentically. I was instinctively being present. Now, my instinct is to <em>try</em> but it takes a great deal of effort not to swing my eyes down and read that text, queue up my email, or even skim an article on the Internet. Why on Earth am I skimming some random article that I will forget about in half an hour, rather than committing myself to the people I am physically there with?</p>
<p>As I have written about before, much of our more destructive smartphone behaviour does come down to how we use the devices, not anything inherently wrong with the devices themselves. The challenge, however, is that the way the devices work naturally taps into our addictive tendencies and literally compels us to anti-social and unproductive behaviours. These realities of the hardware and software aren&#8217;t going to change anytime soon, leaving us to struggle against a gravity well of inattention of bifurcation.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t easy solutions. Ultimately I think the devices are more good than ill, and the turbocharged lives we lead are masses of potential. However, given that theoretical potential &#8211; imagining how we could be at our best in the world empowered by these devices &#8211; we aren&#8217;t anywhere near enjoying that promise. We move too quickly without being mindful, and we give our attention to the magic box in our hand as opposed to the living people in our environment. As humans are wont to do we&#8217;ve swung from one extreme &#8211; being alone with our thoughts and temporal reality &#8211; into the opposite. Now, we are overly focused on data from devices that is often mundane and far too often not resonant. Given that there are benefits to this extreme, and the chemical rewards our bodies permit us for following the habit, making change is non-trivial.</p>
<p>As for me, I am increasingly conscious of not being mindful, and not being present, and have a growing understanding for how important those things are. I&#8217;m going to really work on my willpower, to resist the urge to give myself to the magic box. Instead I&#8217;m going to try and implement Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s method into my own life. You will certainly still catch me sneaking a peek at that shiny little screen every now and again, but if I am successful this will occur increasingly less and finally, perhaps, cease altogether.</p>
