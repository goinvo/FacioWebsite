<figcaption>Successful leadership depends greatly on the context and the needs of the people being led.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I vividly remember a happy meeting with a departing intern. I authentically celebrated her good contributions, she earnestly complimented me in ways I would not have imagined, and it was the very best of what a boss-employee parting should look like. It reminded me how much I genuinely enjoy the people I am able to work with in the right way.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the right way.&#8221; That is a complicated little turn-of-phrase. You see, I am extremely introverted in ways that create interpersonal challenges. I dislike large group settings: although I am able to perform admirably on demand, in the context of an everyday work environment, I don&#8217;t and can seem cold and distant. I also dislike inauthentic interactions: when I am able to &#8220;dive deep&#8221; with someone and pay attention to them while they pay attention to me, my relationships are very powerful. However, when the time involved or nature of the interaction is more superficial, I become impatient. Which, again, can make me seem cold and distant.</p>
<p>This particular employee called me a &#8220;great leader&#8221; and that she could not imagine a boss would eschew a hierarchical relationship and be so warm, engaging and directly involved in her well-being and development. This, of course, is the most humbling and appreciated feedback I could possibly get. But so many past people I&#8217;ve worked with would guffaw at the words &#8220;great leader&#8221;, because they knew me in a different context that was less in my wheelhouse for success, or even when I was younger and less developed as a person. While it was joyous to hear those words and know they were authentic and even reasonable for that particular person, I am under no illusion that I am a great leader. I can be, and sometimes am. More often I am, like most people, performing in ways that range from adequate to very good. Rarely great and rarely terrible, I&#8217;m doing my best in contexts that are uncomfortable and with people that I may or may not fit well with.</p>
<p>One of the secrets to being the most of who we can be &#8211; with &#8220;most&#8221; being more of a qualitative than quantitative descriptor &#8211; is understand how and why you thrive and putting yourself into those positions. My particular weaknesses do not translate well to effective leadership in a traditional sense, but each day I am trying to tune myself as well as my contexts in order to more reliably and repeatably be participating in situations that could result in people seeing me as a great leader. Of course I want to be; I just also want to remain resonant with my essential self.</p>
<p>For others, your limitations and strengths and comfort levels are unique and, in most cases, vastly different from mine. The secret for each of us is to get in touch with these things and design our lives to resonate with the best and strongest parts as much as we can. From there we will not just become potentially great leaders, but people living better lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we&#8217;ve looked at four core ways for analyzing Facio Behavioural results, let&#8217;s step back and consider how they work together:</p>
<p>Methodologically, Facio Behavioural identifies success and opportunity via alignment. That is, the better aligned†<strong>any</strong>†of the constituent data is, the healthier and more appropriate an individual&#8217;s behaviour is. Conversely, the more disparities there are, the more potential difficult nuances there may be with that person&#8217;s behaviour, and/or their ability to develop in different ways if that would be appropriate.</p>
<h2>High Self-Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Someone with a high degree of self-satisfaction who either exhibits an unrealistic self-perception, or has a large behavioural gap, may have difficulty acknowledging they should consider development, much less actively pursue it.</p>
<figure style="width: 412px; margin: 0px auto;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" title="High Self Satisfaction" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/high_self_satisfaction2.jpg" alt="High Self Satisfaction" width="412" height="252" /><br />
<figcaption>This person is happy with their work style, as are those they work with. But others perceive them much differently than they see themselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Realistic Self-Perception</h2>
<p>A person with realistic self-perception and a low degree of self-satisfaction may indicate someone very ready for development, or someone unable to develop in that area. Those are two very different things, and here you can bring in Gap Alignment to help ferret out which is more likely. Meanwhile, someone with a realistic self-perception who also has a large behavioural gap may not understand what the people around them or the context they are participating in really require from them. In that case they will first need some re-framing and new contextualization before development is likely to be successful.</p>
<figure style="width: 452px; margin: 0px auto;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-617" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Low Self Satisfaction" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/low_self_satisfaction2.jpg" alt="Low Self Satisfaction" width="412" height="252" /><br />
<figcaption>This person has a remarkably realistic self-perception, both for how they are and how they contextually should be.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Small Behavioural Gap</h2>
<p>An individual with a small behavioural gap and low self-satisfaction may indicate the person is operating in ways that are uncomfortable for them. This realization can lead to significant personal development, but also the specter of potentially massive &#8211; and frightening &#8211; personal change. This can, in part, be validated by checking their Facio Preference results and seeing if the behaviour in question is indeed against preference.</p>
<figure><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-625" title="Perceiver" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/small-behaviour4.jpg" alt="Perceiver" width="600" height="229" /><br />
<figcaption>Considering the previous person, when considering they are an MBTI perceiver, developing a more relaxed work style will probably make them happier, as well as more effective.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A person with a small behavioural gap and an unrealistic self-perception will likely need some reinforcement of how they are seen by others being quite different than how they see themselves. While they should be pre-disposed to agreeing with the development path there may be some pre-work to ensure they have a proper frame for the situation.</p>
<p>Hopefully this overview of Facio Behavioural gives some insight into how powerful Facio can be, along with providing guidance and tools to unlocking it. While Facio is designed to allow the curious and honest explorers among us to work on self-development very aggressively, the real magic is often found when an experienced coach or counselor uses Facio with others. The combination of an objective perspective with training and experience in its use are truly powerful. Be well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://fac.io/report/4f75192b713be629f400001c/behaviours/1axis/" target="_blank">Facio behavioural reports</a> are powerful, versatile tools in the development process. Not only do they offer strong, direct 1-to-1 development with the self-assessment but the 360 aspect adds extra layers of richness and insight. Facio Behavioural can be used either in conjunction with one&#8217;s Myers-Briggs style preferences &#8211; creating a powerful view into the intersection between preferences and behaviours &#8211; or as a stand-alone tool used with any other preferred methodologies.</p>
<p>In this five part series we will look at a variety of ways one can review reports from Facio Behavioural and use the results toward productive development for yourself, or others you are working with. The first aspect we will look at is Self-Satisfaction, which you determine from comparing one&#8217;s self-actual and self-ideal results.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="alignleft"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_personality.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-494" title="Facio Behaviours - Personality" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/behaviour_personality-300x184.jpg" alt="Facio Behaviours - Personality" width="300" height="184" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>I would very much like to be more outgoing. Unfortunately extraverted behaviours make me uncomfortable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This comparison gives you an indication of how comfortable the person is in their own skin, insofar as each, specific professional aspect being reviewed is concerned. Criteria where the self-actual and self-ideal are the same or within one of each other indicates the person is largely satisfied with how they behave in this context. When the self-actual and self-ideal is two the person is somewhat dissatisfied with how they are behaving. Criteria where the self-actual and self-ideal are separated by three or greater is exhibiting significant dissatisfaction with how they are behaving.</p>
<p>Getting the most of Self-Satisfaction requires considering it with other aspects of Facio Behavioural, which will be covered in subsequent articles. The final article, Part 5, will look at how to consider these aspects together as a system.</p>

<figcaption>The Myers-Briggs Type IndicatorÆ is the most used and best-proven tool for psychological preference</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Over the last two years I&#8217;ve finished certification on three different psychological tools, with the fourth to finish up this summer. The one that has the longest history is the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a><span class="small-superscript">Æ</span>. The MBTI measures our †&#8221;preferences&#8221;, which are our inherent comfort levels. What I like about the MBTI are three primary things:</p>
<p>1. It is based directly on the work of Dr. Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychiatry, and has over 90 years of validation between the original concepts, the MBTI method developed between the 1920s and 1940s. It is a honed and proven approach that most people find useful.</p>
<p>2. The MBTI is the most-used personality tool of any kind in corporations. Hundreds of millions of people have taken the MBTI, and its application in the workplace is well understood with proven success models. This name recognition and underlying proven quality will help people appreciate and identify with the openness of Facio as a service.</p>
<p>3. The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation encourages the active and responsible use of their tools. This is in direct contrast to most of the psychological assessment industry, which generally has a very closed and insular perspective on how their tools intersect with the world. Given the openness of Facio, and our belief in the importance of broad availability and dissemination of preference type, the philosophies of the Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation very closely aligns with the spirit we want to put out into the world.</p>
<p>For most people, their exposure to the MBTI or other Myers-Briggs style came in the workplace, or perhaps in a career consulting context. In both cases, there is a dedicated focus on talking about the &#8220;different-but-equal&#8221; nature of preferences and focusing on individual strengths. Those are good and valuable things, and certainly core to what we are offering with Facio. But given all of the data collected over many decades, there are known facts around preference types which can help people better leverage knowledge of their type and others. For example:</p>
<p>- There is significant difference between the amount of people of each gender in each and every type. The types with the most males as compared to females are INTJ (3.3% of all men are INTJ&#8217;s versus 0.9% of all women) and ISTP (8.5% of all men are ISTP versus 2.3% of all women). Meanwhile the types with the most females as compared to males are ISFJ (19.4% of all women are ISFJ versus 8.1% of all men) and ESFJ (16.9% of all women are ESFJ versus 7.5% of all men). More broadly, there are more women of every F &#8211; Feeling type while there are more men of every T &#8211; Thinking type</p>
<p>- EJ&#8217;s &#8211; Extraversion Judging &#8211; are statistically the most satisfied with their work, as well as most satisfied with their company of any of the types</p>
<p>- People who have the same perceiving functions &#8211; either both being S &#8211; Sensing or N &#8211; iNtuition &#8211; have a much higher rate of long-term marriage success than opposite S&#8217;s and N-s that pair up, and are statistically more likely to get a divorce</p>
<p>These are just a few nuggets of data available from Myers-Briggs style type. While Facio is currently focusing on the individual more than the aggregate it gives you an indication of the breadth and potential complex insights that can be divined by tapping the available information.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most difficult parts of understanding yourself is first being aware of, then being attuned to the relationships between, your behaviours, skills and preferences. While there are a variety of tools for measuring these aspects independently, we have not found any tools that integrate them in a useful way. That&#8217;s what our <a href="https://fac.io/report/4f75192b713be629f400001c/blended/spider/" target="_blank">blended report</a> is for. Still, while getting the data is a big part of finding your way to understanding, it really helps to have a basic idea of what you&#8217;re looking at. So let&#8217;s talk a little about these three aspects of the individual and how they work together:</p>
<p>Behaviours are what we actually do in the world. They are how we act, and interact. In some real way they are who we really are to other people: they only know what they are able to see.</p>
<p>Preferences are our inherent comfort levels. They reflect how we most prefer things to be, regardless of how they really are. Often times other people aren&#8217;t aware of our preferences; in fact sometimes even we aren&#8217;t aware of our preferences!</p>
<p>Skills are the abilities we have to function in different ways. We may or may not exercise them at a given moment or in a situation, but they provide a framework for what we are or are not able to do.</p>
<p>While each of those are interesting in and of themselves, deeper insight begins at their intersections. Consider:</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="left"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_pref_other_snapshot1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-582" title="Facio Behaviours &amp; Preferences" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_pref_other_snapshot1-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>While I allow my natural Introversion to come out with people I work closely with, I behave much more like a Thinker than the natural Feeler that I am.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Behaviours and Preferences. Considering these two together give you an indication a to how much a person is functioning within their natural comfort levels. While we homo sapiens are a tough and resilient lot that can successfully behave in ways that are not consistent with our natural preferences, it is generally not the healthiest and happiest way for us to be. Identifying misalignment between behaviours and preferences can help people gain awareness and understanding of aspects of their life that might be unknowingly contributing stress and discomfort. While valuable on an everyday basis it can be particularly informative as people are ready to change teams or jobs or even careers, helping them to more proactively define engagements and environments that align their personal comfort levels for what and how they are performing their responsibilities.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px;" class="right"><a href="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_skill_other_snapshot1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-584" title="Facio Behaviours &amp; Skills" src="http://facio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/beh_skill_other_snapshot1-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />Click to view</a></p>
<figcaption>Despite my strongly Introverted behaviour, my solid skills around communication and interaction come through.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Behaviours and Skills. When viewing these two together you are able to get a sense not just of what the person is doing, but also some degree of how well they are doing it. People with very strong skills in a particular area &#8211; say, communication &#8211; will often have behaviours that are harder to pin down with specificity. Why? Their skill in that area allows them to communicate in the way most appropriate to the situation or people they need to interact with. On the other hand, when someone&#8217;s skill is very high and their behaviours are more extreme and specifically defined, they are likely very skilled at a particular method or style of communication but not necessarily adept at customizing for different situations. They just have their way, and do it extremely well.</p>

<p>Preferences and Skills. Analyzing these two together can provide valuable insight into the relationship between what someone is comfortable with and what they are good at. Often times, these things line up. We naturally gravitate toward things that make us comfortable, and in the process become better at those things through repetition. However there are also times where our preferences and skills look very different. This can be due to a number of factors, including our inherent strengths and weaknesses or gaining skills to better succeed or fit into our environments. Alignment between preferences and skills can provide insight into how people might react in certain situations. Major differences between preferences and skills may reflect a person who has worked hard to succeed in ways not naturally comfortable for them, but which seemed necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, bringing all three together provides even deeper opportunities for analysis and insight. In a later update I will use my own profile to share some examples of the power and potential of that. Have a great rest of the day!</p>
